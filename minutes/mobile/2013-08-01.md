## Ghislain Seguin
* Moved zip files out of CDN onto web server https://jquerymobile.com/resources/download Thank you so much to Anne for going through all the blog posts to change the urls!
* Fixed node-amd-builder/issues/9 which caused jquery-mobile/issues/6253
* Got access the CDN git repo and started thinking about how to modify our release script to add / commit / push to that repo instead of scp’ing to code.origin.jquery.com. That’s what I’m going to work on this week.

## Sven Franck
* Pretty busy, but could help out on table / filterable issues (if still needed)
* working on carousel widget http://www.franckreich.de/jqm/carousel/demo.html
