## Todd
* Download builder - released
	- Updated for 1.1.1 today too: https://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/
* Device donation page - done
	- Linked here: https://jquerymobile.com/donate-devices/
* 1.1.1 final - released today!
	- https://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/07/12/jqm-1-1-1/
	- ThemeRoller and Download builder updated to be in sync
* 1.2 alpha - final tweaks underway, hoping for alpha late next week
	- code review (Bender and Ghislain) - done
	- speed: takes 1-2 seconds to open the most minimal popup which is too slow. Suggestion: change the default transition to “none” from “fade” which seems to go much faster. Look for other optimizations.
	- default styling - done (thanks Jasper!)
	- add position option to center the popup over various thing (link, window, selector)
		* data-position-to=”origin|window|selector”
		* origin is the default (the link you click to open it)
	- Android 2.3.x nav issue (Gabriel) - fixed
	- Gabriel to look at dealing with the nav dependency with popup to remove this requirement, may be added post alpha but before RC
	- Add 3 events for popup to hook into popups for customization
		* "popupbeforeopen", "popupafteropen" and "popupafterclose"
	- change log in progress (thanks mauriceG) - http://test.jqmobile.de/commit12a.html 
* Site re-templating for the conference - met with Richard, Todd is working on porting over the static pages, Richard to port the blog, then we need to make CSS changes
* Roadmap - Todd to start sketching out based on UI discussion
	- UI and mobile will stay separate for foreseeable future
	- Share a lot of code and infrastructure between projects

## Ghislain Seguin
* More code re-org, moved widgets into widgets directory
* Fixed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3558

* Getting feedback on download builder UI

## John Bender

## Gabriel Schulhof
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4595
	We publicly support changePage with changeHash: false, but we don't support navigating to the page inserted with changeHash: false
	We could document that, if people do push pages into urlHistory with changeHash: false, then they're on their own, or we could help them out by displaying the last page in a changeHash: false sequence when going back, and displaying the last changeHash: true page when navigating forward, like so:

```
      ╭─⬎ ╭─⬎ ╭─────────────⬎ ╭─⬎ ╭─⬎   going forward
    ███→███→███→▒▒▒→▒▒▒→▒▒▒→███→███→███
    
      ⬑─╯ ⬑─────────────╯ ⬑─╯ ⬑─╯ ⬑─╯  going back
    
    ███: page added with changeHash: true
    
    ▒▒▒: page added with changeHash: false    
```

* Images inside popup: Let's provide an "opening" signal to give app devs the opportunity to size the popup contents before the in-transition starts.
* Work on making unit tests pass in FF.


## Jasper de Groot
* just done some triage and bug fixing
* popop: issue with image max-height - we have to discuss this

## Anne-Gaelle Colom

* Triage
* added new resources to the resources page
* Would like the team to look at:
	- https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4606 (Is technical aspect ok?) Can this be pulled in or is there some rework on same page transitions?
	- https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4583#issuecomment-6841271 
* get back into the api docs
