## Ghislain Seguin
* kinda stuck in the code re-org because of the depend! plugin:
	- going to attempt moving the depend plugin
	- or upgrade to RequireJS 2.0
* Q: Feedback on builder?
* Q: Are we going to mention it at jQCon? Yes

## John Bender 
* jquery-ui using grunt-junit
* de-linting almost finished
	- master only
	- Thanks Gabriel!
	- Damnit Scott!
	- adding to the build
* new README
* Q: css lint
* Q: performance setup

## Gabriel Schulhof
* Tab issues: Get tab navigation to work. Try to keep tab inside popup - futile. scroll to 0 when dismissing a popup opened from another popup - prevented, but there was a flash (looks like briefly scrolling back to 0). FF is fine. Is the flash still present?
* Link blurring performance (4340) - not likely to be able to do the perf tests.
* Proposals:
	- Link can open popup from another page (agcolom)? IOW, if user clicks link button and the popup referred to by href has not been enhanced, enhance it? If the popup is on another page, it's not a good idea because the other page has display: none set and the popup is its child, but if the popup is inside the body, it can be enhanced at first-click time.
	- .buttonMarkup({corners: <value>}) accepts true, false, and now also "tl", "tr", ..., "left", "right", etc. https://github.com/gabrielschulhof/jquery-mobile/commit/f49abba3d0d3ee5f490d778ead3b705392fabbee and http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/jqm-buttonMarkup-corners/tests/functional/button-markup.html
	- This could help us fix 3635, because controlgroup wouldn’t need to access button classes directly, instead calling .buttonMarkup({corners: ”left”}), etc., thus cooperating with reusable buttonMarkup, such that if you later call e.g. .buttonMarkup({icon: ”another-icon”}) on a button that is part of the controlgroup it won’t mess up the button’s corners as a side effect.

## Jasper de Groot
* finished buttons & form PR
	- still some minor Opera issues to look into
* navbar/grid wrapping and gap - fixed 3 issues
	- need test results from Todd (WP and iOS) before merge
* update page padding (see above)
* IE submit button issue - working on test page and fix
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4303

## Anne-Gaelle Colom
* a few commits for docs (minor corrections/corrections)
* 14 new articles on the resources page
* worked on api resource site:
	- dialog, collapsibles, collapsible sets complete (basic info). More info can be added. Will complete by the end of the week
	- slider: complete with full info
	- modified the XSL file to display all methods/events/options
	- modified XSL file to display the correct example base code

	- Helping Jasper test on BB5 Devices 
	
# Open dev questions

#4340 - do we need to blur() all links anymore now that gseguin has added the link tracking?
https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L1267
I’ve tried with that line commented out and the problem from #1840 (which caused the above line to be added) did not re-occur - Improvement:
37.7% on my N900
78.9% on my desktop Chrome 20
29.4% on my desktop Firefox 12

Opera mini bug - text focus https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4311#issuecomment-5733560

### PhoneGap blinky transitions
Scott's recent fix for blinking in PhoneGap seems to be pretty solid, though I've see a few reports that some issues remain. Since PG is a big deal, we should probably accelerate 1.1.1 for release in the next 2-3 weeks.

### Fixed toolbars / updatePagePadding / header and content switched
Many related issues

### Re-enhancement after manipulation
buttonMarkup() and/or controlgroup()
https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4317
https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3635
Gabriel can have a look at these

### Button/form consistency
https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4098#issuecomment-5469381
new PR + test page (Jasper)
Test box-sizing border-box on WP: jsbin.com/emaziy/ (Todd)
do we want form elements in toolbars to default to mini with option to override?

### Link styles
PR #4385
Should we add styles to protect buttons from a: basic styles?
https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3444
Cascade issue bar link colors + reorder pseudo classes
TR issue #73 - links in bar not themable, always same as JQM default theme (Tyler Benziger)

### 2.3 nav issues
The back button doesn’t work in 2.x in some situations. The proposed fix is a revert back to the old timeout based prevention but doesn’t prevent the popstate triggered navigation like the previous version did.

# 1.2 Features  
Issues: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=13&page=1&state=open

### Popup: prototype & API
* Prototype: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-widget/docs/pages/popup/index.html
* Options: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-widget/docs/pages/popup/options.html
* Methods: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-widget/docs/pages/popup/methods.html
* Events: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-widget/docs/pages/popup/events.html
Do we want popup to turn into a dialog when it gets large, as suggested in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4329#issuecomment-5764484 - this would remove even more code from custom select, but do we want this for 1.2?
Progressive enhancement: [ Login ] -> [ Popup: [ Username ] [ Password ] [ Log in ] ] If not enhanced, this results in two login links.

### Read-only lists
New styling including removal smaller font-size and padding of ui-li-static for 1.2 #4347

### Grid widget?
have the framework adding the ui-block classes (same as navbar widget)
data attribute # columns
