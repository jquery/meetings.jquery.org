## Todd
* Good progress on 1.3 features
  - RWD tables are in good shape, finishing docs and demos: https://jquerymobile.com/branches/tables/docs/tables/index.html
  - Please review and post feedback on the issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5093
* New API site and demos to replace current demos & docs - need to discuss a plan and timing - can we hit this for 1.3?
* How to better document the nav model in the new API style - John Bender to work with Anne on this. Move the nav stuff out of core to better isolate?
* Corner radii being standardized with the controlgroup - now all use button radii. Need to discuss impact
* Can we package the AJAX anv model more cleanly so it’s not part of core and just a plugin? John Bender to look at this, will help Anne with how to document

## John Bender
* Progress continuing on navigate event integration into existing nav code
  - corner cases abound
  - 50% of the tests passing

## Jasper de Groot
* docs & demos
  - worked on reorganizing and cleaning up docs & demos files to make them ready for restyling and moving parts to new API documentation https://jquerymobile.com/branches/new-docs/
  Q: what is the plan? where do we gather new demos?
  - created a “view source code” solution (have to clean up and tweak the syntax highlighting stuff)
    example:https://jquerymobile.com/branches/new-docs/docs/demos/popup-panel/index.html
    convention: wrap markup in <div data-demo-html="true">
    add data-demo-js="true" data-demo-css="true" to grab script/style from the head
    template for demos: https://jquerymobile.com/branches/new-docs/docs/demos/demo-title/index.html
* triage: below 300 open issues!

## Anne-Gaelle Colom
* 15 new resources on the resources page
* Experienced with automatically generated examples in the API docs and discovered issues there (Buttons vs buttonMarkup)
* Proof reading of new table docs
* minor corrections to existing docs and api docs
* We need a list of what else needs to be documented (via issues on https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/)

## Gabriel Schulhof
* Need to merge:
  - 4974-move-non-option-constants-to-defaults-object: Which other options shall we move? Please fill out https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n7ozvhQTLhBj6sPR-LYxuev3p8kcbHjlAM8EBMlQ8GE/edit so I know which way to go before I submit the PR
  - button-markup-corners-can-be-string: Convert controlgroup to widget and fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3635 where, if you call buttonMarkup on a controlgroup item at runtime, the item gets rounded corners (PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5241/) Please review thoroughly because it touches buttonMarkup
* Shall we cherry-pick the fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4317 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3637? They should either both be picked, or neither should be. Decided not to pick, only for 1.3

  - Reset form
