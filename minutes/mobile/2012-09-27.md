  - 2 outdated folders - exclude from zip if possible or delete?
    * css/themes/valencia
    * experiments/scrollview

## Anne-Gaelle Colom
* This week I have completed button and popup widgets (api docs), including examples. Popups may need a bit of polishing, so will give this another look tomorrow or this weekend.
* I will revisit all currently completed widgets and add code examples to methods and events.
* Then I aim to do listview.

## Gabriel Schulhof
* Building nav sequence tests for various funky initial conditions:
  - http://domain/path/to/page1.html (ok, not so funky)
  - http://domain/path/to/page1.html#&ui-state=dialog
  - http://domain/path/to/page1.html#/path/to/page1.html&ui-state=dialog
  - http://domain/path/to/page1.html#/path/to/page2.html&ui-state=dialog
* with and without pushState. Test cases so far:
  - Open dialog, close dialog
  - Open popup, close popup
* Found #5100 in the process of testing c. with pushState disabled.

## Ghislain Seguin
*     Will start working on https://github.com/gseguin/node-amd-builder/issues/4 to remove much of the manual steps involved with adding a new release to the builder.
