* Attending: Gabriel Schulhof, Alex Schmitz, Anne-Gaelle Colom, Jasper de Groot

## Official Agenda:
* what needs to be done before we can release 1.4 alpha? (Jasper)


## Updates:

## Jasper de Groot
* created a doc with summary of things done/discussed in Portland https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aRm9SvK7DpQaxotODvwlA7Wek42f3M6ffd1L8LGEG7k/edit?usp=sharing
* on vacation until June 26

##Anne-Gaelle Colom 
* corrections to the api docs:
	- fixed dead links
	- removed inline styles
	- updated jquery core and mobile versions for v mouse events example

## Gabriel Schulhof
* Started flattening custom select: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6108
* Need to make it work outside the page before I can study the performance impact of the way we create various bits of DOM. Iâ€™m pretty sure if we have a template which we create and clone the first time, and merely clone on all subsequent occasions, then we can gain a significant performance boost (https://jsperf.com/create-vs-clone-with-params).
* Alex had the idea to separate the show-as-dialog functionality and place it into an extension. This functionality must be unavailable when the custom select is placed outside a page, because we cannot display a dialog on top of random content.

## Alexander Schmitz
* started reviewing textinput 
* tests with ui widgets.
	- Tabs: Done no extension other then autoinit
	- Spinner: Done minor extension
	- menu: Done in effect makes nested list views
	- autocomplete: still needs work js:done css:none
	- whatever we dont include for 1.4 (all but tabs) i will put into my own repo and maintain until added to library and make demos
* Core: seperate data methods out into their own module
	- add unique id to core for now?
* updateing code.jquery.com to include 1.3.1 this is manual html editing process that needs to be done each time and changes pushed i have access to server so i can do this from now on. 
* explored need for pointer events patch to vmouse with kborchers looks like this wont be needed will test more once i have WP8 tomorrow
* tracking and aquireing dev phones have list need to add peoples personal test devices ( will prevent aquireing dups)
	- added nokia lumia 520
