## Updates:

## Jasper de Groot

* last Wednesday UI/Mobile meeting
* working on external panels, transition, zoom, url bar issues
* reviewing methods API documentation (will finish this after 1.4 alpha release)

## Todd Parker
* Icons: we’re going to go with Grunticon but with a non-JS config option to make the default icon loading as simple as possible
* Default CSS loader: Each page can link to a single CSS file that covers both SVG and PNG fallbacks:
  - This file will contain the inline SVG rules AND a set of .no-svg prefixes rules that link to the external PNG fallbacks
  - This file will ensure coverage for all devices, but browsers that need the PNG fallback will incur a performance penalty because each icon will be a separate request
* We will encourage people to use the JS loader instead which only requires a simple JS config for the CSS file paths. This approach offers more efficient delivery compared to the default CSS file approach because you only download the SVG or PNG rules and we try and load SVGs as inline when possible to avoid the added requests
  - This loader will use the standard Grunticon approach of doing a feature detect and serving one of 3 files:
    * inline SVG
    * inline PNG
    * PNG with external images
  - If using the script loader, a noscript block in the head with link to the external PNG CSS will also be required
* We discussed the idea of making the external PNGs a sprite, but this will add selector complexity and a manual process to generate the sprites. Instead, we will document how to the use JS loader for better performance.
