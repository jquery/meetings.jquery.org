## Todd
* 1.3 Beta - no blockers, just waiting for more testing
  - Targeting RC1 within the next 7-10 days, 3-4 issues we’d like to button up first
* Work well underway on the new demos site, IA and templates coming together and this will be a focus in the near term so we can fully retire the old docs:
  - Collecting examples and templates here - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/
  - Example of a new widget page with copy/paste html viewer - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/buttons/
  - Q&A section with common issues (need authors) - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/faq/
  - Open question: should we keep guides or do this all on the learn site?
