  - Only 3 open issues for the the 1.3 milestone, none critical
  - Jasper is doing a final round of re-factoring on the panels to improve Android webview performance in the panel-refactor2 branch. Preview
  - blog post in-progress for 1.3
  - should we preview the new API docs in the blog post?
  - will focus on the new demos site IA/design once beta goes out
* Maintenance releases - Jeff Lembeck is working on a tool to generate drafts of these based on our formatting needs, update on this soon
