* created a “classic” theme - helps with upgrading
* made an overview (with todo’s) of project information and documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWN1UAncQHcmDfy9UuD_ftMtyhQhWiq3inYm0ReE-J8/edit?usp=sharing

## Alexander Schmitz

  - https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile-nestedlists
* preparing presentation for austin
* working on 1.4 bugs

## Gabriel Schulhof
* Working through API docs
  - Found out that I need to do several passes over all the docs:
    * Theme swatches
      - Remove c,d,e
      - a → b
      - c → a
    * Include standard methods (enable, disable, etc.)
  - Added enhanced and wrapperClass (where applicable) to
    * button
    * checkboxradio
    * collapsibleset
    * collapsible
* Helped Alex and studied nested lists
* Had a big realization: You cannot override inherited things in a subtree ad infinitum ☹ This means that if nested lists are indented by default with an optional class to turn off indentation, if that class is applied to a sublist, then all its children will have no indentation, but if you then specify a second class which turns indentation back on on one of those children, then the children of that child will still not be indented. A simple example using background-color: https://jsbin.com/iLIqEG/5/edit
* Found out and fixed that collapsible and collapsibleSet do not correctly handle option value changes to the options ”corners” and ”inset” correctly. Added unit test to make sure those options are set back and forth while maintaining correct presence/absence of the ui-collapsible-inset class.

## Ghislain Seguin
