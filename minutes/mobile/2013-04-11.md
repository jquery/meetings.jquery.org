* Attending: Todd Parker, Jasper de Groot, Gabriel Schulhof, Ghislain Seguin

## Todd
* Focus on 1.4 right now
  - Theming
    * Markup & style simplification
      - Jasper working in the “next” branch
      - Trying to eliminate the need for buttonMarkup and wrapping elements, simplify button classes and markup
      - Test page of simplified HTML/CSS (no js) with icon fonts - http://view.jquerymobile.com/next/demos/test/icons/font-icons.php
    * Possibly expand theme levers: listview (menu) so we can have a unique flat style for lists vs. buttons
    * Icons - SVG vs. icons
      - Testing icon font compatibility (see below)
      - Need to do the same for SVG via Grunticon
      - Compatibility result testing in progress for icons: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdEFwbzNFSmJjWUd1dkZldDY4MVFyR0E#gid=0
    * Pre-processor research
      - Hoping a CSS pre-processor could help with class mapping between UI and Mobile. See http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/65050459/Classes%20Option
      - Need to set up a test of this, maybe with SASS/Compass
  - API/Performance Re-factor
    * Gabriel and Alex are focusing on this
    * Replaced jqmData with getAttribute in listview - http://jsperf.com/listview-jqmdata-vs-getattribute/2
    * Centralized the option setting for widgets
    * Going to look at dialog and form element API complaince/standards first
  
## Jasper de Groot
* hangout about theming with Todd, Scott and Mat last week
* have to see what is best approach for theme inheritance
* we might still need to use JS to add classes because we can’t use data- attr selectors in CSS because of namespacing
* testing font icons vs. SVG icons (grunticon) http://view.jquerymobile.com/next/demos/test/icons/font-icons.php (test buttons also have simplified markup)

## Gabriel Schulhof
* Triage:
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5898
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5892
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5893
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5906
  - Tests to cover triaged bugs
* Optimization: listview now uses $.mobile.getAttribute for a moderate gain

## Ghislain Seguin
* adopted jQuery’s .jshintrc & fixed associated lints
* Added lint target as a first step to test
* Fixed Download builder ( and stayed polite with the users who “wanted it fixed ASAP!” )
* Removed the depend! plugin in favor of RequireJS’ shim config
