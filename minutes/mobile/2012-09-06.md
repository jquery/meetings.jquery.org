* Testswarm … (tough)

## Ghislain Seguin
* Back from a week off
* Addressed a few issues in the builder back-end:
  - Use command line args instead of environment vars
  - Use jQuery’s simple logger
* Moved the backend service to the jQuery infrastructure as Joyent is eol’ing the no.de machines
* Left to do is to remove one of the manual step which requires a “manual” checkout on a new branch which can be avoided
* Spent some time trying to reproduce a popup issue we were having at Jive without much success

## Maurice Gottlieb
* Working on a CSS solution for an issue with header/content/footer corners in popups having data-corners active. Now testing some kinds of edge cases. I'll ask Jasper to look into until/at next weekend.
* Having still the listview icon option "at the table" (setting the icon on listview instead for each list item). Last PR was unpopular cause of too compact coding. Have to speak with Jasper again (and may need a second opinion).

## Jason D Scott
* Finishing up internal BB project to be announced,
