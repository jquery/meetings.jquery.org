## Ghislain Seguin
* Talked with Ralph about where the download builder would fit in the new website, we decided to make it should be part of it
* grunt, grunt, grunt! What’s working:
  - JS build with minification and sourcemap (yay!)
  - CSS consolidation and minification
  - Copy of images
  - Zipping -> dist/jquery.mobile.zip
  - Testing via QUnit/PhantomJS with XML reports output for CI
  - Testing against any version of jQuery via --jquery flag (will rename to --jqueries) ie --jquery=1.7.3,1.8.0,git
  - Added ability to run a subset of suites via --units flag (will rename to --suites) ie --units=event,navigation
  - Found a way to work around the PHP dependency for tests which means no more apache/php needed. The simple connect http server that comes built-in with grunt is enough. I’ve added a middleware to the connect server which intercepts request for /js/ and returns the built bundle. It also validates that our built jquery.mobile.js is working.
* There are now 2 kinds of builds:
  - grunt dist and grunt dist:release the :release flag will pick up the version from the package.json as opposed to the git SHA1 hash.
* Left to do:
  - 2 main suite failures left that I might need help with:
    * tests/unit/navigation/sequence/sequence-push-state-disabled-dialog-hash-key-tests.html
    * tests/unit/navigation/sequence/sequence-push-state-disabled-tests.html
    * leading to: 38/775 assertions failed (399454ms)
  - deploy
  - add a flag for theming
  - cleanup target
  - testswarm
  - anything else?

## Alexander Schmitz
* worked with john bender on nav came up with game plan to add
  - ability to pash hashes to pages
  - ability to deeplink to id’s
  - ability to manipulate the hash without adding history entries (push state only)
  - as a way to auto open panels and popups should linking to a url with a hash for a panel or popup open it?
* started nav work
* added faq pages (all of them in the forms category are complete now)
* 1.4 planning with todd and Gabriel
* worked with todd to come up with plan for AJAX in the docs
* triage and bugs
