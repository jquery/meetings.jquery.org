* Attending: Todd Parker, John Bender, Jasper de Groot, Anne-Gaelle Colom, Gabriel Schulhof, Alex Schmitz, Jeff Lembeck, Ralph Whitbeck

## Todd
* Good progress on 1.3: 14 open issues / 36 closed - Responsive focus. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&milestone=19&sort=updated&state=open
  - Sliding panel widget work underway in a branch, will need docs and demos soon
    * panels will also have a responsive element where we could have a demo showing how we could display a panel and hide the open/close button above a certain width
  - RWD intro started (very basic): https://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/grids/rwd-basics.html
  - Responsive grids w/default breakpoint: https://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/grids/grid-stack.html
  - Responsive tables: https://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/tables/index.html
  - Clear button option for text inputs: https://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/textinput/index.html
  - We’ve decided to add a dual handle range slider for 1.3, in progress
* Will focus on release notes for 1.1.2 and 1.2.1 this week so we can get those released
* Next: new demos site to compliment new API site for 1.3
* 1.4 is looking like it will be heavy on re-factoring for speed, consistency and performance

## John Bender
* 3 tests left before the merge. Not including the sequence tests.
* Internal work

## Jasper de Groot
* textinput clear button landed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1834
* fixed iOS preventFocusZoom issue iOS https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5333 https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3690
* made some changes to demo source code view: max height + scroll, better performance
* not sure what to do with these Symbian issues (can we reproduce? should we degrade?) https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&labels=Symbian&milestone=&page=1&sort=updated&state=open
* now working on slider CSS (full width), also for new range widget
* will push demos for new options (dialog close button, etc.), table styling, and methods (API docs) this week
* continue working on new docs for 1.3
  - discuss structure and content with Todd and Anne
  - make “real world” and RWD demos

## Anne-Gaelle Colom
* Modilfied the following widgets for the new version of grunt (generated examples for options, methods and events)
  - Slider
  - Dialog
  - Collapsible
  - Select
  - Textinput
  - Popup
  - Listview
  - Collapsibleset
* Created the following event entries:
  - Updatelayout
  - Pageremove
  - Swipe
  - Swipeleft
  - Swiperight
* Other changes:
  - Designed a warning style to draw the user’s attention to a warning paragraph
  - Created the getting started with jQuery Mobile guide on the learn site (most of the guide is based on the original guide which is on the current docs.)
* working on the api style guide (our widget description is long so the quick-nav section is not in view... which I believe is a problem for us...)

## Gabriel Schulhof
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2383 - can we remove that return false out of checkboxradio vclick?
* Pending nav refactor
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4512 - popup should emit pagebeforechange using data.role=”popup” not data.role=”dialog” - it uses data.role=”dialog” because that triggers special handling in nav
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4966 - dialog -> dialog <- back -> dialog results in 3 dialogHashKeys being tacked on, not 2
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5249 - failure during pageshow causes nav to break forever because we never turn isPageTransitioning back off. We should put the ._trigger( ”hide” ) and ._trigger( ”show” ) inside try {}, but then we absorb errors, with the risk of being annoying to developers.
  - Idea: To fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3136 (assuming the refactor does not fix it) we can introduce an option to changePage: data.back. When present, if set to true, it goes back, otherwise it goes forward. The url for the pbc event is retrieved from urlHistory.

## Jeff Lembeck
* Slide-panel is mostly workable now. Missing a few tests. Still needs tests for dismissible, and needs implementation for transitions and _destroy.
* Work happening here in a branch: https://jquerymobile.com/branches/slide-panel/docs/panels/index.html

## Alexander Schmitz
* re-wrote swipe event to allow extending it.
* wrote extension to fix swipe on ios and demo extending swipe (this will NOT be part of the library)
  - https://github.com/arschmitz/JQM-Swipefix/blob/master/swipefix.js
* First draft of range slider in range branch gallery at
  - www.uglymongrel.com/jqm/range.html
  - range slider fills full width for better usability working with uGoMobi: to sync with his work on full width slider
* general triage bug fixing.
* issue #5035 touch events are missing teardown.
  - this could have performance implications if people use them a lot

## Ralph Whitbeck
* Working on managing the jQuery Mobile Cookbook project.  A book that will be published through O’Reilly Media, which is a community effort to write the book in an open source fashion.  More info http://jquerymobilecookbook.com
* Working on creating and submitting jQuery Mobile talks to various conferences for next year.
* My presentation slides from jQuery Asia https://speakerdeck.com/rwhitbeck/in-depth-look-at-jquery-mobile
