## Anne-Gaelle Colom
* completed textinput in api docs (doc + inline examples) and added inline examples to search inputs.
* This week, I want to get buttons done.
* Then, I am thinking to complete in the following order:
  - Toolbars (header bars, footer bars, navbars)
  - Popups
  - Listview
  - Page Loading Widget

## Gabriel Schulhof
* Fixed #4994 and #5021
* Idea for future navigation: make the URL generation a plugin that is, separate URL generation from history tracking/manipulation

## Jason D Scott
* Added listview option to set the link icon (for 1.2.1)
* More work on BlackBerry 10 theme (should be released next week at BBJam America)
