## Todd
* Making good progress on 1.3 features: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&milestone=19&page=1&sort=updated&state=open
  - RWD tables: Reflow and column modes are done, need to review before merging to master. Demo: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/tables/docs/tables/index.html
  - Listivew filter option (data-filter-reveal=”true”) to hide items for local auto-complete. Demo at bottom of page: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/listviews/listview-filter-autodividers.html
* Starting to collect release notes here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.3-Release-Notes
* There will be maintenance releases for 1.1.2  and 1.2.1 in the coming weeks - more info soon
* Looking at ways to radically simplify markup and styles for future releases for faster performance and easier customizability for folks who don’t want to use the theme system. Important to explore this before we start the process of moving UI over into the theme framework. 

## John Bender
* Working AJAX nav cleanup - all hashchange tests are passing now
* Helping Anne documenting nav for the new API docs
* Looking at decoupling nav from core a bit more for 1.3 

## Jasper de Groot
* changed all corner styling logic from JS to pure CSS with Gabriel http://jquerymobile.com/branches/css-corner-styling/index.html
  - most probably need to add some JS to select first/last visible element in groups :(
  - added option corners for: dialogs + collapsibles + (inset) listviews, added option shadow for (inset) listviews
  - we have to update the unit tests before merging
  - we have to update the TR: corner classes have been removed from theme CSS
* folder /demos is now on master /docs/demos/ http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/
  - added examples of most components - useful as reference and for testing
  - next: adding RWD and dynamic content “real world” demos
  - view source code: code wraps now
* fixed programmatically setting options
  - listview “filter” https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5245
  - checkboxradio & textinput “mini” https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4070
* Q: for 1.3 or 1.1.2/1.2.1? those are not new options

## Anne-Gaelle Colom
* Added index page to api docs
* Merged Checkbox + Radio button into Checkboxradio widget
* Merged Slider + Flip-toggle into Slider widget
* Merged Search input + Text input into Textinput widget
* Still need to merge Header + Footer + Content into Page.sections widget
* Created the following method entries (note: they all need proper examples):
  - jQuery.mobile.changePage()
  - jQuery.mobile.loadPage()
  - jQuery.mobile.path.isAbsoluteUrl()
  - jQuery.mobile.path.isRelativeUrl()
  - jQuery.mobile.path.get() 
* Now officially on the jQuery Content team and attended our 1st meeting (Thursdays 1pm ET)

## Gabriel Schulhof
* checkboxradio icon: if controlgroup is initially vertical, icon is displayed, but if then changed to horizontal, icon must disappear
  - there is a js solution, but uGoMobi is working on a CSS solution too
* unit test timeouts: seems like they go away if I add lots of console.log statements :(
  - also, phantomjs has a way of dying if I lose connectivity, even though it only deals with localhost
* When do we merge css-corner-styling?
* Some progress on documenting controlgroup

## Ghislain Seguin
* Still working on builder (slow progress)

## Alexander Schmitz
* Mostly working on presentation for jQuery Asia thank you uGoMobi for all your help!
* PR #5260 is ready to merge will close #3748, #4113, #4250, #4337, #4410 - packaged as an extension to fixed toolbars for 1.3, just landed in master
* need review of pr #5262 destroy should reset padding on fixedtoolbars
