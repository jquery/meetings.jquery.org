## Open dev questions

Issue #4340 - do we need to blur() all links anymore now that gseguin has added the link tracking?
https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L1267
I’ve tried with that line commented out and the problem from #1840 (which caused the above line to be added) did not re-occur - Improvement:
37.7% on my N900
78.9% on my desktop Chrome 20
29.4% on my desktop Firefox 12

BlackBerry 7.1 Transitions https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4001 documentation about -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;

Auto-scroll expandibles - Todd to test https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3520#issuecomment-5702502

Opera mini bug - text focus https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4311#issuecomment-5733560

### PhoneGap blinky transitions
Scott's recent fix for blinking in PhoneGap seems to be pretty solid, though I've see a few reports that some issues remain. Since PG is a big deal, we should probably accelerate 1.1.1 for release in the next 2-3 weeks.

### Fixed toolbars / updatePagePadding / header and content switched
Many related issues

### Re-enhancement after manipulation
buttonMarkup() and/or controlgroup()
https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4317
https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3635
Gabriel can have a look at these

### Button/form consistency
https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4098#issuecomment-5469381
new PR + test page (Jasper)
Test box-sizing border-box on WP: jsbin.com/emaziy/ (Todd)
do we want form elements in toolbars to default to mini with option to override?

### Link styles
PR #4385
Should we add styles to protect buttons from a: basic styles?
https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3444
Cascade issue bar link colors + reorder pseudo classes
TR issue #73 - links in bar not themable, always same as JQM default theme (Tyler Benziger)

### Navbar buttons
buttons wrap on BB5 and IE7, buttons leave a gap on probably all other browsers depending on available width - Jasper

### 2.3 nav issues
The back button doesn’t work in 2.x in some situations. The proposed fix is a revert back to the old timeout based prevention but doesn’t prevent the popstate triggered navigation like the previous version did.

## 1.2 Features  
Issues: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=13&page=1&state=open

### Popup: prototype & API
* Prototype: https://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-widget/docs/pages/popup/index.html
* Options: https://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-widget/docs/pages/popup/options.html
* Methods: https://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-widget/docs/pages/popup/methods.html
* Events: https://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-widget/docs/pages/popup/events.html
Do we want popup to turn into a dialog when it gets large, as suggested in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4329#issuecomment-5764484 - this would remove even more code from custom select, but do we want this for 1.2?
Progressive enhancement: [ Login ] -> [ Popup: [ Username ] [ Password ] [ Log in ] ] If not enhanced, this results in two login links.

### Read-only lists
New styling including removal smaller font-size and padding of ui-li-static for 1.2 #4347

### Grid widget?
have the framework adding the ui-block classes (same as navbar widget)
data attribute # columns
