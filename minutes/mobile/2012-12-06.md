  - Non-prefixed page animations for IE10 support - we have branch up with non-prefixed transitions and updated 3D and transition tests - going to land soon - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/unprefixed-transitions

## Ghislain Seguin
* Looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5096
* When can we start using Mergeatron?

## Scott Jehl
* Jeff and Matt have done some great work on the panel and I'm looking to help smooth the transitions. We're making progress We’ll likely want to use some HW accel on the elements involved in the panel transitions *only* during transitions, for memory reasons. The slide-panel branch has an unconditional 3d transform in there now and it appears to be helping a lot in testing. More to do

## Alexander Schmitz
* Created way to do deeplinking in the demo docs
  - this will be for docs only not library
  - will make demo to show people how we do this
* merged rewrite of swipe event
* continued work on range widget
* triage
* Presistant toolbars VERY broken investigating this its a regression.
* tracked down header load issue with reader
