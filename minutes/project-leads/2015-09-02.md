## Mobile
* Selectmenu, table, and panel need updates for classes option
* Working on update to handle UI’s core breakup

## Chassis
* After a lot of discussion regarding naming conventions with BEM, decided to go with a ‘BE M M M M’ naming convention, where modifiers are their own separate classes to make sure that elements with multiple modifiers aren’t a complete headache
* This means that a few ongoing PRs need to be redone, currently in the process of doing that, and stuff should be up for review by next week

## QUnit
* Released 1.19.0 with support for Map and Set in equal assertion

## PEP
* Getting more frequent bug reports, which means we must be gaining users :-)

* Twitter folks have resumed our previous talk about the pilot project.
  * Rafael updated react-globalize [demo](https://github.com/rxaviers/yarsk/tree/react-globalize) for them.
