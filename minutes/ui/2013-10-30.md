    * No de-facto solution for dealing with CSS; maybe defer solving this?
    * Either keep ad-hoc solution in DB, or adopt comments-approach from Mobile?
    * Need an estimate how much effort it is to implement comments parsing as an intermediate solution
* Accessibility

  * https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/145

    * Put it on the Amsterdam agenda
* Selectmenu
  * Landed more bugfixes
  * Experimenting with menu styling
  * More margin:

  * Compact:
  * http://view.jqueryui.com/menu-style/demos/menu/icons.html

    * Progressing, reporting documentation issues in their Trac
* Datepicker
  * TJ filled out the options list on the wiki
    * Will schedule a call when the remaining TODOs are done

  * Still to do:
  * Update $.date to remove the jQuery dependency.
  * Fixing multi-month, WIP
    * Partial fix in for multi-month
  * Discussed moving $.date to Globalize, as its own module, but within the library. Not much favor, need an alternative solution.
    * No dependency except for the namespace, so just need to come up with a name.
* Draggable
  * Mike hardening the testsuite, fixing IE issues
