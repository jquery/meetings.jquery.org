* Duplicates
  * Should get [these](https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7434) [two](https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6642) autocomplete issues with lots of duplicate tickets addressed:
  * TJ volunteered last week, nothing visible yet
* Button
  * [working on checkboxradio and controlgroup](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1216)
  * Did another review and testing round, lots to fix
  * will make controlgroup filter out hidden elements, if too slow, don't use the JS widget
  * will make controlgroup support selectmenu and textinputs, shouldn't require more then a few lines of extra CSS
  * Need to discuss with Jasper and Scott a more generic .ui-btn class as currently in jQuery Mobile, affects selectmenu, button, checkbox; controlgroup could use that instead of each widget individually
  * Decided to support anchors
  * [Focus styling for active radio/checkbox](https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9505)
    * Perhaps add outline to .ui-state-focus
    * Alex to ping Chris Coyier to see if there's a good solution
* Globalize
  * [Working on plural module](https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/220), created a PR for reviewing, still missing functional tests and docs
  * [Discussing support for locale-specific instances](https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/234), Rafael worked on it, will open a PR soon
  * [Working on continuous cross-browser testing](https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/235), sent a PR to fix the issue within browserstack-runner, waiting for that to land
  * [Need a seperate API site](https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/236) - We've got globalizejs.com, still need to create the site
* Selectmenu
  * Fixed some tests
  * [New demo: radius and color of a circle, using two dropdowns](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1230)
  * Felix needs some help to improve ARIA implementation, trying some of the [suggestions Hans posted](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1224#issuecomment-40667414):
  * Jörn and Felix to work on that
* Release
  * Release 1.11.0-beta.1
  * Need to fix menu and tooltip regressions
  * Need to fix prerelease script to push JS files to CDN
  * Should remove -cdn postfix from zip file to put that on jqueryui.com
* Download builder
  * Offer pre-releases? Seems sane for beta and rc releases, since its more likely that people will test those with their custom builds
    * Let's try it with rc.1, since we're likely not doing another beta; or even for beta.1, Rafael will put it on stage
  * buildCSSBundles() from Ghislain's AMD builder is working
  * [Discussing how to simplify our bundle](https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/207), please chime in on that issue.
* Menu
  * [Need to test the PR for the #9995 fix, looks simple enough](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1235), Jörn to test this
