  * The obvious changes are element locations swapping, but there are some more complex situations:
  * [#5440](https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5440) Theme - icon placement, scrollbars (from hidden content?)
  * [#10655](https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10655) Menu - arrow keys for opening submenus
  * [#10658](https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10658) Slider - lowest value on the right
  * Suggestion: Use `dir` attribute in markup to determine direction instead of using an option
  * [PR for spinner based on this suggestion](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1412)
  * Alex to ask Ariya for his contact. Hoping for help from IBM, at least with testing. Also ping Hans Hillen and Dylan Barrel
  * Scott to schedule a call to hash out details with all those who have experience and are willing to help.
  * Compare [KendoUI implementation](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/numerictextbox/right-to-left-support)

* Tooltips in native dialogs
  * [#10739](https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10739)
  * Scott to ping browser vendors and spec authors about odd overflow constraints
* Selectmenu
  * [Should we check for hidden options?](https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10743)
  * Alex says hiding options isn't consistently supported natively
  * Alex to close with explanation
  * Perhaps we shoud advise him to use disabled attr in addition to display:none and hide the generated, disabled items via CSS.
* New default theme
  * [Rafael testing DB/TR integration](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1384/)
  * Decided to make the new theme the new default, as "Base", keep UI Lightness and Smoothness in the TR gallery
  * Update tooltip to use ui-widget-shadow class (via classes option, once that lands), move box-shodow definition into theme.css/.ui-widget-shadow, update TR to demo that instead of the weird fake shadow we have currently
