* Discussed AMD/UMD support for all projects.
  * Will use the [jqueryPlugin format](https://github.com/umdjs/umd/blob/master/jqueryPlugin.js) for jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile.
* All projects will support Bower.
* Working to reduce (and hopefully eliminate) the code necessary to bring jQuery UI widgets into jQuery Mobile.
  * Using the tabs widget as the prototype.
* Finishing changes to download builder for the 1.11 release changes.
* Need to figure out how to deprecate old icons when switching to grunticon.
