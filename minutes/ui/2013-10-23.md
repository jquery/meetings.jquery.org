    * Will rename files after landing globals PR
    * Need to figure out how to deal with CSS files. Pinged AMD community about this.
* download builder
  * Status?
    * Running stable, no complaints from users
    * Can't monitor properly with expired Splunk license

    * CSS-only layer almost done
    * Alex to create a PR for reviewing soon
* Dialog
  * One open PR, need help with fixing unit tests, some test regressions from earlier changes kill the testsuite
    * Scott to look at failures after selectmenu tasks
* Scoped Themes
  * Dialog needs to be appended to a container for scoped themes to work: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9616
  * Could be addressed in DB: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/145
    * Should see how this is solved in Mobile 1.4, talk to Jasper about it
    * Swatches and their inheritance sounds like a much better solution then generating (multiple) themes with scopes
* Selectmenu
  * Felix waiting on feedback on width options
  * Questions in wiki comments
    * Still need to reply/answer
    * one width option for controlling the button, menu gets auto width or override via CSS; add menu widget list item top / bottom margin;

* Classes Option
  * http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/65050459/Classes%20Option
  * Alex to finish his testing. Status?
    * Still needed, not just for compat with Mobile themes
* Effects Rewrite
  * Mike asked for review, got one from Corey: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1017
  * Otherwise, two issues: 1. failing tests (which I think are faulty tests), 2. one of the effects actually needs to modify layout, so that one should use placeholder, but the placeholder should shrink accordingly
  * Any news since last week?
    * Nothing new
* CLDR
  * Rafael to test date formatting/parsing with datepicker rewrite; number formatting/parsing with spinner
  * Status?
    * Nothing new
* Datepicker
  * TJ filled out the options list on the wiki
  * Alex to test the rewrite on mobile and report issues. Inline datepicker seems like the wrong solution.  Status?
  * Still to do:
  * Update $.date to remove the jQuery dependency.
  * Fixing multi-month
    * Will schedule a call when the remaining TODOs are done
    * Maybe move $.date to Globalize, as its own module, but within the library
* Draggable
  * Mike verified the draggable testsuite
  * Will fix bugs he caused earlier
