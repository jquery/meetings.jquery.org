## Trac
* Volunteers are making progress on new setup
* Let's give it a few weeks
* Github issues is still an option IMO if Trac stays this bad

## $.xhr
* Scott's proposed API
 - https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/cc85abedbca0ae4e9f47
* Uses chaining Promise for setting args
* Downside: requires Promise always
* will be supported in 1.x branch if possible
  - significantly reduced functionality (no XHR2 or CORS)
* Promise lib?
* $.xhr() returns Promise so we MUST have shim in the bundle
* Insulate via jQuery.Promise = window.Promise || jQuery.PromiseShim

## markelog to look at a super basic thenable we could build using Deferred
* perhaps build Deferred on thenable?
* jauborg returns! Work with markelog on Deferred
