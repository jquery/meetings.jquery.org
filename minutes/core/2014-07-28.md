* shouldn't affect anyone using documented API

## hide and show mess
* https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/15037
* Can we simplify to just display:none for hide and display:block for show?
* ...or even absence of display:none for show?
 - probably not because initially-CSS-hidden stuff wouldn't be shown
* Eliminates defaultDisplay mess and saving states
