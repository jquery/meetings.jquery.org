Ajax

Need to refactor ajax dependencies to new file

-   serialize, param, parseJSON, parseXML
-   otherwise it’s hard to use other ajax impls like \$.jsonp
-   jaubourg to change

Making promises resolve async

jaubourg has a possible solution

-   separate method to resolve sync

dave will start thread in jquery-devs-team

jQuery.unique – no action to be taken

What needs to be done for beta2?

    fixes
-   Possible effects issue, gnarf to investigate – scott already fixed!
    WIN!
