-   need an update to QUnit for the fix to raises()

Manual modularity

Great progress here, thanks guys!

mikesherov added dependency mgmt

jaubourg working on ajax

Need a simpler tool (not necessarily by release)

-   complexity prevents wrong ppl using it

Drupal? this isn’t for their use case (dave imo)

use AMD wrappers? watch out for cross-module variables!

Compat repo for deprecated/removed stuff? – dave

-   Separate plugins including compressed versions
-   Combined plugin with everything
-   “Debug” version with console.warn msgs?

Documentation

Deprecations – dave created tickets, will finish docs

Animation hooks Tween etc. — gnarf to outline

Other things needing docs?

.css(‘width’) respects box-sizing, .width() doesn’t; dimension setters –
mikesherov

vendor prefixing

-   automatic – ‘boxSizing’ will get ‘MozBoxSizing’
-   can create cssHooks for vendor-prefixed, which get priority over
    non-prefixed
