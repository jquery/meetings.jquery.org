## Problems with testswarm

## jQuery 1.11/2.1
* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oQ966Lq9szqP41BehdlmAJV33lgNcrE0C0tktLvIz5s/edit
* (action items and conclusions below summarized from meeting discussion)
* requestAnimationFrame - Do not pull into core, gnarf has a plugin for people who want it and we'd still break a lot of existing code if it was the default
* Alternative animation API (initially a plugin) - leave to third parties
* Alternative AJAX implementation - jaubourg to noodle over
* Deferreds and Callbacks optional modules - yes, after AMD is settled
* make .ready() its own optional module - yes, and discourage its use
* Use AMD - yes, timmywil is on it
  - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14113
* Deprecate/remove jQuery.support? - Can't remove, but move feature detects into their respective modules and make them lazy, reduce forced layouts; next step to be done after initial AMD is finalized
* Avoid offsetHeight/offsetWidth completely - yes, mikesherov?
