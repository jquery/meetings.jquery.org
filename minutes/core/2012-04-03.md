1.8 (April 9 Beta)

Dev on master or branch? Consensus: 1.8 on Development Branch

1.8 Feature branch — we’ll land PRs there?

Specific process?

-   Make standard PRs but against 1.8 branch (after I create it)
-   [https://github.com/jquery/jquery/branches](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/branches)
-   Um, create 1.8 branch (BRANCH is 1.8pre b/c there was 1.8 subs?)
-   WHY CAN’T I label PRs? (gnarf: maybe bc issues are off?)

Several PRs ready to land

jaubourg has been a good boy

Pinged Chad Killingsworth re Closure Compiler, he made a Sizzle PR for
some issues to simplify CC work (haven’t reviewed it yet)
