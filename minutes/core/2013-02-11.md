## Siovene update/discussion on perf

## jQuery 2.0b2
* This week - Day?

  - Optional qSA/mS Sizzle stub
  - https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13434

## jQuery Migrate 1.1.1 late this week -- Dave
* Todos marked in Github issue tracker:
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/issues?milestone=3

## jQuery 1.9.2
* I think we can wait a couple of weeks

## Version/feature correspondence (from last week)
* Make 1.10 track 2.0? (So 1.11->2.1, 1.12->2.2, etc)
  - in next major point release, don't execute scripts by default
  - Let's leave this an open issue until we know what might need to be in each version

## Open tickets triage
* https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13428
 - Lets hold off on action for now, potentially document that native events should not depend on using trigger data and use .triggerHandler if you need to pass data
