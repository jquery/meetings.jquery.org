strip\_iife branch ready to land – if we want to

-   line numbers in errors are for the built code – not the src/files.js
-   We seem to think that the benefits outway the debugging/development
    minor hassle
-   source maps?
-   LAND IT!

JHP for serving – land it?

-   Need to coordinate with testswarm – Krinkle?
-   Can’t land until jenkins issues are resolved

Need update to README to reflect current build process

-   There is a “draft” of these instructions in the strip\_iife branch
-   LAND IT!

Closure Compiler Advanced Optimizations (CCAO)

-   Talk with Chad Killingsworth
-   He will rebase against 1.8 later this month
-   We will land most of the CCAO unit test changes
-   timmywil, did CCAO changes land in Sizzle?

Manual modularity

Landed gibson042′s modularity for effects

Others?

-   ajax?
-   css and dimensions – mikesherov

Compat repo for deprecated/removed stuff? – dave

-   Separate plugins including compressed versions
-   Combined plugin with everything
-   “Debug” version with console.warn msgs?
-   We can host these on code.jquery.com, perhaps other CDNs

Documentation

Deprecations – dave created tickets, will finish docs

Animation hooks Tween etc. — gnarf to outline

Other things needing docs?

.css(‘width’) respects box-sizing, .width() doesn’t; dimension setters –
mikesherov

vendor prefixing

-   automatic – ‘boxSizing’ will get ‘MozBoxSizing’
-   can create cssHooks for vendor-prefixed, which get priority over
    non-prefixed

Remaining 1.8 items

-   [http://goo.gl/ewuKx](http://goo.gl/ewuKx)

New items?

-   Adding new callbacks for animations –
