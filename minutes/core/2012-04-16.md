1.8

-   gibson042 kicked lotsa bytes out
-   Need performance and memory leak sanity check
-   Land this week? Still \~+200

Refactor to allow leaving animation/ajax/(others?) out

-   Yehuda eliminated an ajax dependency in unit tests
-   More work to do there

Land the grunt pull?

-   mikesherov and DaveMethvin to figure out Windows issues

Chad Killingsworth’s CCAO changes

[https://github.com/dmethvin/jquery/tree/ccao](https://github.com/dmethvin/jquery/tree/ccao)

needs TLC on its build stuff for grunt

Proposed plan of action:

-   Leave on a branch for 1.8
-   Get unit tests and basic examples working
-   Call for community input and help
-   Further 1.9 integration contingent on that

What else needs to land?

-   timmywil to get Sizzle changes

jQuery.quickReady

-   Can we just always ignore state of iframes?
-   can’t use window.load since it fires once
-   perhaps flip the default state to allow for faster loading?
