Minutes (Notes) of the meeting of jQuery

Location: \#jquery-meeting on Freenode

Time: Noon ET  

Official Agenda:   

jQuery 1.6.2 Status

-   We're getting the RC out today.

Talked with Closure Compiler team, they’re fixing bugs, should be good
for the team

We’re working on dates for an upcoming bug triage day, possibly late
June

Firefox version support moving forward

-   Mozilla has dropped support for 3.0 and 3.5, makes sense for us to
    do the same
