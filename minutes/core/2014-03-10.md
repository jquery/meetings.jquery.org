* Dave to create new ticket
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1532

  - YES, but commit the new tests
  - m_gol to do it
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1531

 - Just document cssNumber? YES

* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1527
 - LGTM
 - m_gol: I’d hold off, probably reverting the !important patch will fix it by itself. I’d just land the tests
