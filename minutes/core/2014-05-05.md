## The demise of jquery-latest
* Google folks are on board to make /1/ point to 1.11.1

## CSS selector escaping?
* https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14692
* https://github.com/mathiasbynens/CSS.escape/blob/master/css.escape.js
* Kind of big and we don't use it, maybe just document this and tell people where to get it?
