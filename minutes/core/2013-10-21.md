* m_gol raising discussion here:
  - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mozilla.dev.js-sourcemap/HsImWQq9J8g/jaRrwfp85OwJ
* Remove file from map and use CDN reference to map?
* See discussion on IRC â€¦ several problems still happen
* Either
  1) wait for Chrome to stop complaining about missing "file" property in the map file and use an absolute path
  2) remove the map
* Always provide the (local) map file for custom builds

## jQuery 1.11/2.1 final
* How do we publish to npm?
* How do we publish to bower?
* Need to update build script to create tagged headless commit for release
* Should include bower deps and built file for simplicity
  - Timmy to update the release script
