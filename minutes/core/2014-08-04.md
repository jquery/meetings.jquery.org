## hide and show mess - https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/15037
* Following up on last week's discussion: Is this feasible really?
* Initially CSS-hidden elements need to work with .show()
* Simple display:block show will break tables without some special case
* Probably several other breakages
* In any case let's avoid making it more complicated, but what can we simplify?
* gibson042 to do a PR for a simplification
* .hide() always results in display: none; .show() results in display: "" unless there was a pre-existing non-none value, in which case it will use that
