## Jenkins/testswarm status
* Browserstack fixed their IE9 issue (thanks Krinkle)
* boxSizingReliable patch to make FF stop complaining (orkel has a pull)
* "order" (orkel to remove the unit test since it's browser-specific)

* Let's get to where we can trust the unit tests in Jenkins/swarm

 - Current approach (use jQuery props for public API) is fine
 - timmywil to make progress on build this week
* Performance tests (orkel)
 - Can we have a dashboard that combines units, perf, coverage?
