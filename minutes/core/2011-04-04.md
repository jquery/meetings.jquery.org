 Location: \#jquery-meeting on Freenode  
 Time: Noon ET

Official Agenda:

-   Q&A – jswartwood & dataEvents ( someone is actually using them )
-   Bug Triage Sprint was a big success, cleared out unreviewed tickets
    -   Focus now is on clearing out [old open
        tickets](http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=reopened&type=bug&component=%21datalink&component=%21global&component=%21templates&component=%21web&milestone=%211.next&milestone=%211.7&milestone=%211.6&group=component&max=200&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=owner&report=7&order=id)

-   Should we re-consider:
    -   valHooks (the more modest version)?
        1.  [https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/295](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/295)

    -   Deferred.chain/Deferred.always?
        1.  [https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commits/deferred.1.6](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commits/deferred.1.6)
        2.  .always seems like a wise idea to land
        3.  [http://forum.jquery.com/topic/a-case-for-deferred-chain](http://forum.jquery.com/topic/a-case-for-deferred-chain)

    -   When do we we move features into master for alpha
        testing/release?
    -   jQuery 1.6 Status ( beta release of 1.6 on April 15th )
        -   2 (danheberden, jaubourg): Have .animate() implement a
            deferred object
            1.  works for queued animations, not for un-queued.

        -   5 (jaubourg): Do support tests in an iframe document (or
            maybe use false body element)
        -   10 (dmethvin): Optimize RegExp used for innerHTML shortcut
            (\#6782, pull 248) — This wants to add \<select\> to the
            list; need to see if selectedIndex still retained when we do
            that.
        -   13 (john): Add :focus to Sizzle
        -   14 (rwaldron): Allow properties to be passed in to
            \$.Event() constructor
            1.  [https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/301](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/301)

        -   15 (dmethvin): Perf improvements for .data() events — in
            general, we won’t fire data events if nobody attached a
            handler (detected by jQuery.event.global count).
        -   16 (danheberden): Optimize validation in parseJSON
            1.  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/300

        -   17 (rwaldron): Fix event firing order Turns out this is a
            branch of \#7340, which is Dave Methvin’s
        -   20 (dmethvin): Attach data cache directly to element — In
            process, need to create separate list for global events.
            Eventually  (1.7?) we will only support firing ajax\* events
            on document and remove global events entirely.
        -   21 (dmethvin): Refactor jQuery.event.trigger/handle — Branch
            is passing unit tests; landed 4/6.
        -   22 (dmethvin): Issue with triggering of focusin – may be
            fixed by pull 260, need to check with Joern who reported a
            problem i couldn’t repro Fixed in 1.5.2
        -   23 (timmywil): Allow .is(), .find(), and .closest() to
            accept nodes
            1.  [https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/206](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/206)
            2.  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/283

        -   31 (jaubourg): Synchronize animations based upon start time
            (Thunderdome!)
            1.  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/synchro-anim.1.6

        -   34 (john): attrHooks
            1.  [http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3685](http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3685)
                DOM0, Prehistoric document.forms API issue
            2.  [http://oksoclap.com/attrhooks-bugs](http://oksoclap.com/attrhooks-bugs)

        -   36 (lrbabe, timmywill): Use requestAnimationFrame \*Special
            attention to optimizing size
            1.  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/216 original
            2.  [https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/298](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/298)timmywill
                revisions

        -   38 (danheberden): \$.map() working on objects
            1.  seems pretty close to ready according to dan
            2.  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/299

        -   39 (rwaldron): .undelegate() doesn’t work on custom
            namespaced events
        -   42 (timmywil): .closest() fails on disconnected nodes
            1.  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/291

        -   45 (john): Make .width() work correctly for inputs
        -   46 (john): jQuery throwing error on replaceWith
        -   51 (danheberden): Support relative values for .css()
            1.  [https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/78](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/78)
                original
            2.  We wanted to see this patch DRY’ed out a bit, but we
                discussed in meeting and determined that it would
                probably introduce overhead to share this code between
                modules, and it’s not that much repeated code.
                 consensus was in favour of landing as-is. Dan is going
                to clean up the code a bit more.
            3.  [https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/297](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/297)
