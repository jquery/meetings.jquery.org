 Minutes (Notes) of the meeting of jQuery  
 Location: \#jquery-meeting on Freenode  
 Attending: DaveMethvin, gibson042, timmywil, mikesherov  
 Time: Noon ET

Official Agenda:  

Mergatron status?  Currently in beta test, came up Saturday

-   Issues?
-   Summon with @jquerybot retest ?
-   Whitelist of allowed summoners?

Dave pinged 15 recent new contribs to suck them back in; no bites yet

Availability over the next month?

-   Dave out (teaching a class) December 2,3,4 in NYC but otherwise full
    speed
-   others?

Early beta of 1.9 on December 9? Need the following by then:

-   All major feature removals and behavior changes landed
-   jquery-compat plugin supporting removed features and behaviors
-   Upgrade guide describing major changes (Dave)

Split for 2.0 (meaning 1.9-stable branch and 2.0 is master) on Dec 16?
Later?

-   Earlier split means we can start 2.0 sooner
-   Also means we’ll need to cherry-pick and potentialy nasty merges
    though
-   Wait until post-split to land oldIE bug fix tickets
-   We should aim to keep unit tests basically unchanged (leave oldIE
    tests)

Documentation – Upgrade guide

-   [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rYH6C10gOl0q5iQTxBcAGcS4ZAlt7tuFs3psHHnxJdk/edit\#heading=h.8fpe85x0x8wa](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rYH6C10gOl0q5iQTxBcAGcS4ZAlt7tuFs3psHHnxJdk/edit#heading=h.8fpe85x0x8wa)
-   Dave to reformat into Markdown
-   Will have to be built manually based on tickets that land
-   Please add notes for new stuff as you remember it, I can clean up
