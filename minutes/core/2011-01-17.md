CORE

-   jQuery 1.5 Beta 1 Done
    -   Bugs Team: Need to make sure that recent bugs are tracked and
        turned into blockers.

-   Status of jQuery 1.5 RC
    -   Ajax Rewrite Status
        -   Julian working on docs with Karl
            -   http://oksoclap.com/jq-api-ajax

        -   Should be feature complete now
        -   Julian doesn’t see any new major issues
        -   Got a review by Snover
            -   Some code needs to be moved around a bit, Julian looking
                in to.

    -   Deferreds Status
        -   Implemented \$.when() joined statements
        -   Added some unit tests and added some fixes for the promise
            method
        -   Julian considers them to be done
        -   Dave is working on docs
            -   Docs/tutorial are important for people to be able to
                test from
            -   If possible to get something together pre-release so we
                have time for more people to test that would be great.

        -   Evaluate if we should expose a ready promise for 1.6

    -   Subclassing Status
        -   Adding a new isolated mode today (would optionally protect
            from jqueries triggering each others events)

            -   https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.subclass/

PLUGINS

-   Timeline for official plugin B2s (tmpl, datalink, global). End of
    Jan reasonable? Impacts UI Grid timeline.
-   jquery-global
    -   Joern moved functions from \$.\* to \$.global.\*
    -   Proposal to create globalization interface methods (such as
        \$.format and \$.parseFloat, \$.parseDate) at \$.\* and leave
        jquery-global implementations in \$.global.\*. This would allow
        for alternate implementations while still providing a standard
        interface for plugin developers to target/use. Including
        jquery.global.js would import implementation and alias/proxy
        \$.\* to \$.global.\*. For this to be effective, the \$.\*
        methods dummy/interface methods would need to be added to jQuery
        core so all plugin authors could make use of them.
