## $.xhr strawman
* https://gist.github.com/dmethvin/43ffd1c743554e5c50ae
 - Feedback?
 - Always have $.xhr return a Promise? Deferred? thenable?
 - Others can promisify using the node-like callback
 - No consensus here
 - markelog to prototype some things for the next meeting
* Continue to enhance $.ajax?
 - e.g. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1541
 - (no progress events in Promise so how would we support in $.xhr?)

## Download builder in 1.12/2.2?
* Yes, or No?
* Need to be able to test individual modules
* Use jQuery UI builder as a guide

## Trac sucks
* But moving to GH issues would be really hard
* https://github.com/trustmaster/trac2github might be worth a look
* Need to maintain Trac and move to 1.0
* Dave to put out blog post call for Trac help

## Test fails
* TestSwarm, no browsers are scheduled
  - m_gol restarted
* Migrate: button.attr("value", val) failing, jQuery 1.8 or older
  - http://swarm.jquery.org/result/1914335
  - dave to take a look

## Pulls
* Support responseURL
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1615
  - Why do this unless we can cross-browser?
  - Pull looks nice tho .. maybe get their help on $.xhr?
