jQuery 1.7 Roadmap

[http://bugs.jquery.com/report/501](http://bugs.jquery.com/report/501)

Voting on Bugs:

-   The  
     point of voting on the blockers is that they're, previously
    nominated  
     by just one person as being a blocker – we use this opportunity
    to  
     determine if it should remain a blocker (and be fixed) or if not,
    get  
     bumped down to a lower priority.

Voting on Features:

-   In the case of feature/enhancement requests – either land it or
    close the bug as wontfix

Form is now closed

Team members should have permission to vote, please let John know if you
don’t have access, for some reason.

Voting should be done by June 6th
