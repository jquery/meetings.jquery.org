  - Just rename to bool? yes
  - Ping Closure guys about it (dave)

## jQuery 1.10 
* Should follow 2.0(.1) behavior
* Perhaps get a 1.10 beta out before 2.0.1 to find shared issues?
* Dates?
  - May 2: Beta 1
  - May 8: RC (if needed)
  - May 16: final (tentative)

## jQuery 2.1/1.11 changes
* Injected HTML <script> behavior formalized/restricted
* $() and .append() etc won't run scripts
* You must use $.parseHTML(html, [doc, ]true)
* If the platform supports further restrictions (e.g., stripping inline handlers) we reserve the right to use them in the future if true isn't passed
* Remove .context and .selector fully

## jQuery Migrate XSS
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/issues/36
* Should be easy to fix, but not sure why I pulled out the check
* Good seed material for 2.1/1.11 blog post
