Landing 2.0 changes

jQuery 2.0 needs browserset “popular-no-old-ie”

want to keep the support.js unit tests

-   they let us know when it’s safe to remove a check

Stale code in the repo

-   Strategy for keeping and maintaining code?
-   Remove oldIE tests from 2.0 branch (dave)

Perf testing

-   Need some to prevent perf regressions and prove 2.0 improvements
-   focus on big-picture hot paths
-   mikesherov and rwaldron to talk this week

Style guide

-   rwaldron proposes using js-beautify
-   Let’s find a way to automate/standardize using this
-   Perhaps a grunt task, and instructions in the contributing/readme?

Renamed jQuery Compat to jQuery Migrate – Thanks snover!

[https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate)

Where should bugs be handled for it? GITHUB

-   Originally I thought Trac, but perhaps Github would be easier?
-   Probably not that many bugs (haha)
-   Just got our first bug

jQuery 2.0 Pass One – Who wants to do some DELETING?

For pass 1 let’s mainly remove hacks and do simple refactors

-   Remove oldIE hacks
-   Simple rewrites using ES5 features if they save code

Don’t make any changes to unit tests (special dispensation required)

Make pull requests prefixed with “2.0″ for review

Branch off 1.9-stable next Monday if possible

2.0 alpha by December 31 (two weeks)?

Do we need tickets? No functional changes so I don’t think we do

while making changes, normalize any browser-specific hacks to

-   // Support: browser version (e.g., Support: Opera \<11.5, IE \< 9)

What about Sizzle?

-   Factoring out oldIE probably won’t pay off
-   Explore a simple querySelectorAll/matchesSelector alternate impl

Specific interest? Grab them now, or later

-   ajax – dave
-   attributes – timmy
-   callbacks – dave (no changes; try/finally fireWith at some point?)
-   core – Rick
-   css – dave (about -300 gz)
-   data – Rick
-   deferred – dave (no changes)
-   dimensions –  dave (just a comment to remove, so later)
-   effects
-   event – dave (about -520 gz)
-   manipulation – Rick would like to work with Richard Gibson on this
    :)
-   offset – dave (no changes)
-   queue – dave (no changes)
-   serialize – dave (no changes)
-   support – perhaps clean this up after we land the other stuff?
-   traversing – orkel expressed interest, dave can back him up
-   build and testswarm changes – dave, with help

grunt 0.4 – wait until after Jan 1 before deploying
