## Trac
* Should migrate closed tickets (with milestone 1.12 or 2.2. or 1.12/2.2) forward to simplify the changelog - there are 16 of them
  -  http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=closed&milestone=1.12&milestone=2.2&milestone=1.12%2F2.2&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=component&report=3&order=priority 
* open tickets should be migrated as well :)
* dmethvin will migrate when trac feels good enough
* Re-set 1.12.0/2/22.0 milestone to 3.0.0?
* Trac still being worked on for archival use, slow progress
