 Minutes (Notes) of the meeting of jQuery  
 Location: \#jquery-meeting on Freenode  
 Attending: DaveMethvin, gibson042, jaubourg, rwaldron, timmywil (cameo
by phone)  
 Time: Noon ET

Official Agenda:  

jQuery 1.8.1

RC or final? (depends on tix that land by then)

This week:  Thursday?

Tickets and PRs we need to land (mark as blocker)

-   sizzle fixes (timmywil and/or gibson042)

jQuery 1.9 & 2.0

Mark your faves as “1.9-discuss” or “2.0-discuss” in the tracker

Intentionally avoiding major rewrites in 1.9 — mostly just deletes

Intend to release 1.9 and 2.0 very close to each other

Aim for alpha after our hackfest in October?

How can we avoid the 1.9.0 bug rush?

How can we involve the community?

-   Running blog posts about changes
-   More alpha/beta releases?
