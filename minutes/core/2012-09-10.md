jQuery 1.9/2.0

Fix common 1.9/2.0 problems early

-   Removals from deprecations
-   Bug fixes

Branch 1.9 when common work is complete

2.0 work to be done in master

All open tickets should be in play

Let’s do a ticket triage day before the Summit

-   Thursday 9/10 7:30pm (invites sent)
-   Decide which tix should be addressed before branch

Do we need a public call for features? (no)

-   Last one didn’t come up with useful feedback
-   Not looking to add features this time around

Aim for 1.9 beta in early December

-   Long beta period since we’re removing a lot

Aim for 2.0 beta … when? (1.9 beta +2 wks?)
