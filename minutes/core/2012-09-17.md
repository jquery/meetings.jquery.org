 Minutes (Notes) of the meeting of jQuery  
 Location: \#jquery-meeting on Freenode  
 Attending: DaveMethvin, timmywil, rwaldron, gibson042, mikesherov  
 Time: Noon ET

Official Agenda:  

jQuery 1.8.2

Would like this to be the last in the 1.8 line

Let’s stay conservative

-   No regressions
-   Only low-risk, high-impact bugs

Blockers

-   The Big Sizzle
-   Others??

Ship date: Thu Sept 20?

Bug triage meeting last Thursday

-   Triaged all new bugs
-   Triaged 1.8.2 bugs

Assigned tickets

Let’s only grab tix when they can be worked on soon

-   Weekly status on assigned tickets
-   Owned tix discourage others from looking/fixing
-   Can we get some of these done during the hackfest?

Currently assigned

-   [http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=assigned&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=milestone&col=changetime&report=506&order=priority](http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=assigned&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=milestone&col=changetime&report=506&order=priority)

1.9/2.0 split

-   land any post-1.8.2 fixes common to both
-   Do the split after that, post-hackathon

1.9 direction on oldIE

-   Fix anything that’s practical (a dozen or so lines of code max?)
-   Wontfix the rest; explain why (perf, size, side-effects) and give
    workarounds

1.9 voting

-   Let’s start voting next week (after 1.8.2 ships)
-   Identify tickets that you think should be discussed/voted
-   Don’t tag uncontroversial tickets that should just be done
