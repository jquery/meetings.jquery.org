## jQuery 2.1/1.11 changes
* Discuss at in-person Portland meeting
* Some thoughts
  - Make Deferreds and Callbacks optional modules
  - Deferred used in .ready() only, never documented
  - Use AMD to do our module builds?  snover has a branch
  - needs updates to grunt build
  - optional dependencies (Deferred in .ready) are tricky
  - Does defaultDisplay really solve a problem?
  - Only reliable way is to append, THEN hide. That doesn't cause extra reflows does it?
  - Our "visible" check causes reflows, can we fix that?
  - Need to use display:none vs .offsetHeight/Width
  - Would fix issues like <br> visible bug
  - Either changes the meaning of visible, or requires climbing the tree to determine visibility
  - Avoid offsetHeight/Width completely
  - Always a whole number
  - Screws up zoomed results and subpixel rendering
  - Attach data directly to elements for faster teardown

## Style guide updates
* Grouping parens need space? (i.e., ALL parens need space)
  - If so do all { need trailing newlines?
  - e.g. var x = { test: true } would be invalid
  - Do all ? and : need surrounding space?
  - We tend to do  b ? v1 : v2;
  - But we do { test: true } no leading space on colon
* Dave to make a pull request against the style guide for comment
