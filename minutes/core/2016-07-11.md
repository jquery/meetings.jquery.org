## Issues needing review
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3214 event shorthands, deprecate or discourage?
  - Deprecation. We still want the option of removal, even if in 5 years.
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3222 Drop 0.x node versions?
  - For now only don’t run ESLint on them
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3193 dimensions without transforms
  - Tabled the implementation details, but came to consensus that existing width/height methods should ignore transforms
