Official Agenda:  

1.8 release

Dave has a trip tomorrow (Tuesday)

-   Thursday 6/21? yes

Will we EVAR PASS unit tests in Jenkins?

need to use documentMode instead of ua sniff for ie8 fail

add IE=Edge to TestSwarm as well? (already there!)

[https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/a416e2ba0d10bf1e1e94b5d023543d38ad08fcfb](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/a416e2ba0d10bf1e1e94b5d023543d38ad08fcfb)

-   TestSwarm already has that, and the iframe sets it, too

remaining 1.8 items: [http://goo.gl/ewuKx](http://goo.gl/ewuKx)

Anything you think should/must land?

-   animation events (already a pull)

Bugs can still be fixed after the beta

If you own a ticket and won’t get to it for 1.8, switch to 1.next

Anything happen on createContextualFragment or insertAdjacentHTML?

-   Yehuda said he had some work
-   Conclusion: pushed out of 1.8

Promises: We can’t make ours “Promise/A compliant”

-   Make sure we’re not advertising such
-   Todo: document Promise/Q

Brainstorming on \$.parseHTML

Can be looser than the \$(html) parse

-   Timmy mentioned possible fixes there
-   Would like to simplify/restrict “looks like html”
-   (starts-with “\<” has been pushed, 6/20)

Want some way to control whether scripts run

-   \$.parseHTML(html, { allowScripts: true }); ?
-   distinguish allow inline vs. external?

Manual modularity

-   Done I think
-   Plan a blog entry for it

Compat repo for deprecated/removed stuff? – Dave (still todo)

-   Separate plugins including compressed versions
-   Combined plugin with everything
-   “Debug” version with console.warn msgs?

Documentation

Deprecations – Dave DONE except for global ajax events

Animation hooks Tween etc. — gnarf DONE

Other things needing docs?

.css(‘width’) respects box-sizing, .width() doesn’t; dimension setters –
mikesherov

vendor prefixing

-   automatic – ‘boxSizing’ will get ‘MozBoxSizing’
-   can create cssHooks for vendor-prefixed, which get priority over
    non-prefixed

git deploy: Jenkins is doing that now (before running TestSwarm)

-   needs an update in build to include commit hash, can be passed by
    Jenkins
