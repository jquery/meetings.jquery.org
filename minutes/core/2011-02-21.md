    -   Announce that date/time during the 1.5.1 release
    -   We need to give devs at least a couple weeks to prepare

-   IE9 support discussion
    -   Should absolutely have official support now, as it’s in RC – we
        can announce that with 1.5.1
    -   A few outstanding issues:
        -   Problem with :nth-child(-) failing (IE 9 failure)
        -   Test for clone is insufficient, causing failures (jQuery
            problem – Snover, rwaldron — John fixed)

    -   Testing:
        -   Install IE 9RC as default browser
        -   Then install standalone IE 6 – 8:
