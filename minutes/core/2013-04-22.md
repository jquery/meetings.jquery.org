## jQuery 2.0
* Shipped!
* Feedback?

## jQuery 2.0.1
* rwaldron's perf improvements for .data()
  - can we do more there? still slower in some cases
* Object.watch/unwatch fix (hasOwnProperty)

  - https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13809
  - Just rename to bool? yes
  - Ping Closure guys about it (dave)

## jQuery 1.10 
* Should follow 2.0(.1) behavior
* Perhaps get a 1.10 beta out before 2.0.1 to find shared issues?
* Dates?
  - May 2: Beta 1
  - May 8: RC (if needed)
  - May 16: final (tentative)

## jQuery 2.1/1.11 changes
* Injected HTML `<script>` behavior formalized/restricted
* `$()` and .append() etc won't run scripts
* You must use `$.parseHTML(html, [doc, ] true)`
* If the platform supports further restrictions (e.g., stripping inline handlers) we reserve the right to use them in the future if true isn't passed
* Remove .context and .selector fully

* Should be easy to fix, but not sure why I pulled out the check
* Good seed material for 2.1/1.11 blog post
