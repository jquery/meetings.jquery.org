## jQuery 1.10
* Create a 1.10-stable branch to land stuff? Or maybe a 1.x-stable?
  - Decision:
* Dave working on blog post; shared here:
  - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-gYLZuEep9OEBBXBiicN-UhA5OkyPwjBHraJEKtvQps/edit?usp=sharing
* Ship a month or two after 2.0, near Portland conf

## Document differences 1.x to 2.x
* 2.x data can be attached anywhere
* ???

## (Add these to Migrate Plugin and document NOW for 2.0/1.10 release)
* No script execute by default, must use $.parseHTML
  - Groundwork for XSS reduction, but not a complete fix atm
  - This would make the no-leading-space restriction unnecessary?
* https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13417 domManip and empty text nodes
* https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12838  $.ajax hook point for domManip
* change Event.isTrigger from boolean to bitmask
