## 1.12/2.2 - Let's get going

## Pulls
* QUnit eliminating globals
 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1586
 - Cannot create globals for everything on our side since e.g. assert is passed as a function param
 - letâ€™s alias globals where we can & change only what remains
* Increase the set of tested browsers in Sizzle
 - https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/263
 - FF 3.6 seems to work
 - prob not worth removing old browsers, so let's leave it
   - Still need to support all selectors for custom selectors and sane scoping behavior

## Tickets
* https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/15131
 - Decode by type regardless of status code?
 - Compat impacts? Nobody should be depending on errors not decoding at this point we could assume?
 - Let's leave $.ajax as is and push folks towards $.xhr

* https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/15127
 - We aren't testing in this env (or several others like Win8)
 - Ways to do this?
 - No obvious solutions here that are easy

* https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10406 https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13132
 - :visible, :hidden behavior change
 - empty elements (with 0 height) will be hidden instead of visible
 - Although, they were only visible in some browsers
 - Will now be consistent for empty elements and <br/>
