* https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14207 (404 for local files) - moved to 2.next due to impossibility of a simple fix
* Focus issues on IE8
* getComputedStyle mess - what to do on non-positioned elements?
  - mikesherov to add comments regarding this on the tickets.
  - Add docs notes that we don't try to patch bugs/spec inconsistencies for all these cases

## Automatically find prefixed event names?

## jQuery Migrate
* Look into unit test failures - dave
* Time for another release, maybe timed with 1.11/2.1?

## Sourcemaps
* Dave to come up with a list of issues regarding them for discussion with the browser devs

## "Inconclusive" test results?
* extend qunit to have tests with flags indicating whether we expect them to fail in this platform (or should be skipped without trying)
* don't litter checks in the unit test code? (centralize somehow)
* put on the back burner unless someone wants to adopt this

## jQuery 1.11/2.1 final
* How do we publish to npm?
* How do we publish to bower?
* Need to update build script to create tagged headless commit for release
* Should include bower deps and built file for simplicity
