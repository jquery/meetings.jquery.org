## Wrap up on browser support in 1.12/2.2
* Dave has draft blog post
* Stop accepting new bug reports on these, close wontfix
* Only fix severe regressions but leave patches in for 1.12 & 2.2
* Sync with UI to remove IE 7 etc support there too
* Still needs edits to clarify, want to prevent wails of protest
* Changes won't come until 1.13, months away
* We'll pull IE6/7, Safari 5.1, Opera 12.1x all at once in 1.13
* per markelog, what about IE7 CV mode in IE8?

## $.fn.data API
* Let's make a call on this, need to make 1.x and 2.x compat
* What is the easiest & least disruptive behavior change?
* I'm leaning towards 1.x behavior with minor changes
* Conclusion: "Embrace HTML5" with one exception: Don't camelize objects that are extended into the data object
* TODO: clean up docs for .data() to make things clearer

## Bower
* Did timmywil's latest updates take care of this?
* e.g. https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14837 (need more info?)

## support.boxSizing - why is the test so complicated & requires a body?
* check old Androids
* ask mikesherov

## 1.11.1 and 2.1.1
* Land fixes soon so we can move on to 1.12 and 2.2 in master
* Can always branch later if we need 1.11.2 etc

## Current open tickets
