## Test fails
* m_gol trying to get all the Browserstack issues resolved
* timeout does not seem to be working
* one job ran 6 days
* we have plugins (neither of them works :():
  - a Jenkins timeout plugin
  - TestSwarm timeout setting: https://github.com/jzaefferer/node-testswarm/issues/14
* disabled Android 4.0 temporarily
* Spawning jobs on Kindle Fire HD that hang
* error messages are not very specific, making diagnosis hard
* mobile devices are failing:
  - Android 4.1 gets stuck on a login screen: https://www.browserstack.com/automate/builds/9eac6d2af8b21a4b4d6581029011d85bbab3f74e/sessions/42504cd22f37b3fa31fc91016adb01aab87273eb#automate_button
  - Android 2.3 gets stuck in the queue, doing nothing and then timeouts: https://www.browserstack.com/automate/builds/9eac6d2af8b21a4b4d6581029011d85bbab3f74e/sessions/41cf9b3bc366f0f5e1a7dccc14ebda8c1c3b3ba7#automate_button
* iOS 7.0 fails for mysterious reasons
* BrowserStack emailed, they’re on it

## Migrate: button.attr("value", val) failing, jQuery 1.8 or older
* http://swarm.jquery.org/result/1914335
* I think the test may need to be removed
* Behavior is correct for IE<9 and jQuery<1.9
* Resolution: Move existing test to the 1.9+ branch in the unit tests
  - gibson042 has a pull

## Support matrix
* iOS 6.1+ since Browserstack doesn't provide older versions
* Android 2.3, 4.0+ (not just 4.0+)
* we have a couple of manipulation failures on 2.3 but no one reported them so let’s claim support

## Dave will be on vacation July 17-26

## $.xhr strawman
* https://gist.github.com/dmethvin/43ffd1c743554e5c50ae
* Updated last week with feedback from comments
* Return value of $.xhr?
  - thenable requires user to translate, and also means we always have a dependency on some sort of thenable shim (e.g., $.Deferred)
  - Promise means we need either a shim or native Promise
  - maybe https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only
* Oleg on a plane right now, will have some thoughts/comments tomorrow
* dave to ping domenic for input on how to add .xhr to Promise instance
* dave to ping snover on collab with Dojo
* mikesherov to ping getify on using native-promise-only for our shim
