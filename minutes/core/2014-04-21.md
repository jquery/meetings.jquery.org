## 1.11.1 / 2.1.1 RC
* m_gol did RC1
* I published an RC1 blog post for about 5 minutes
* I missed the update required to Sizzle (but there was a ticket)
* gibson042 landed it Friday
* Dave set up a VM, can (or will try to) publish the beta today
* To simplify, let's call this RC2 and not speak of RC1 :-)
