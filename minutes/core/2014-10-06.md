## Trac
* Switched to GH Issues
* m_gol to find/change incorrect references to Trac
* Still need migration to Trac 1.0 for security/perf reasons
* dmethvin to monitor progress
* New registrations turned off
* Most accounts have been removed (most were spam)
* Only team/trusted logins left
* If you can log in, you can still create or edit tickets
* should migrate closed tickets (with milestone 1.12 or 2.2. or 1.12/2.2) forward to simplify the changelog - there are 16 of them
  - http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=closed&milestone=1.12&milestone=2.2&milestone=1.12%2F2.2&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=component&report=3&order=priority 
* open tickets should be migrated as well :)

## Promise Error telemetry

## Promises/A+ compat

* the PR is outdated, look at the standard-then-tests-fixed branch: 
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/standard-then-tests-fixed 
* needs review, now converted to std Promise rather than Q
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/d0e5c0447775239edc7819960b7c61b4b71d402f#commitcomment-7914547 
* gibson042 proposing a change for .then().done() not failing, to be done this week

  - https://github.com/search?q=ajaxsetup&ref=reposearch&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93
* markelog to create an implementation

## versioning proposals (see last week for deeper discussion)
* version- and API-synchronized
 - jquery 1.11.1 → jquery-compat 3.0.0
 - jquery 2.1.1 → jquery 3.0.0
* methods & properties existing in both packages have identical signatures & structure for a given version
* public API MUST NOT exist only in jquery-compat distribution
* public API MAY exist only in jquery distribution
* files on cdn are jquery-3.0.0.js  and  jquery-compat-3.0.0.js etc.
* **RESOLVED:** we use the same version number for both branches
* dmethvin to make a blog post
