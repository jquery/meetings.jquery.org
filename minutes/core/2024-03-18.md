## Issues & PRs
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/5388 boolean attributes
	- PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/5451 
	- Docs: Note: because ARIA attributes frequently associate behavior with "false" values that differs from attribute absence, passing false as the value for an "aria-â€¦" attribute will stringify that value to "false" rather than remove the attribute.
	  1. there is no internal list of boolean attributes;
    2. .attr(name) just reflects DOM getAttribute(name); 
    3. .attr(name, false) stringifies the value to "false" if name starts with "aria-" and otherwise removes the attribute
