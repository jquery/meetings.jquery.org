## 1.11.2 / 2.1.2 watch
* Anything that requires a patch release?

## Angular use of .data()
* Makes use of jQuery._data()
* Issues:
  - copying _data(node, ‘events’) won’t work with events with setup/teardown hooks
* Should we expose in the 2.x branch so Angular 1.3 could use it?
  - Yes, we need to leave jQuery._data() in place
  - Perhaps document so people would know to leave it alone?

## Pulls
* rAF https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1578
* Use page viz api to determine whether to run animation
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1577
  - Do we duplicate // Supports comments in support.js and use point?
  - What is the correct form of a // Supports comment?
