## jQuery Migrate
* Look into unit test failures - dave

* How do we test Android?
* Run a jenkins job once week with Android emulator? - dave to look
* sauce doesn't support android <4, dave to ask them

## "Inconclusive" test results?
* extend qunit to have tests with flags indicating whether we expect them to fail in this platform (or should be skipped without trying)
* don't litter checks in the unit test code? (centralize somehow)
* Code style check #12757
  - markelog to land

## jQuery 1.11/2.1 final
* How do we publish to npm?
* How do we publish to bower?
