## 1.11/2.1 release
* Any tickets to land? Only critical ones please
  - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14680 - scheduled for .1
* When? Target this Thursday

## Blog post on delegated events
* https://github.com/blog/1756-optimizing-large-selector-sets
* A bit deceptive b/c he used 500+ events of the same type
* Real case is more like 150 (still huge)
* Bringing back quickIs from 1.7.2 helps a lot

## Test infrastructure
* Totally hosed
* gnarf still stumped
* Asked jzaeffer/Krinkle to unhose this
* Seems related to Jenkins plugin update
* Internal jquery/infrastructure ticket on this

## jquery-release
* Need to double check before doing the release
* npm publishing didn't work right for some reason

## api.jquery.com (and every site on Wordpress!)
* Or rather >every website using wordpress< which is pretty much all of them…
* We're using jQuery Migrate! Really shouldn't
* Volunteers to help fix this? Prob just a bad plugin or .attr() misuse
  - dmethvin and m_gol

## 1.12/2.2 planning for San Diego meeting
*I'll send around a Google Docs link
