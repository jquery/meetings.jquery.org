QUnit 1.6.0 was released, featuring a stable composite addon, a few bug
fixes and enhancements. [More details in the
changelog](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/v1.6.0/History.md).

[swarm.jquery.org](http://swarm.jquery.org/) is now running TestSwarm
1.0.0.

Jenkins integration is now done via
[node-testswarm](https://github.com/jzaefferer/node-testswarm), making
improvements a lot easier and moving configurations into the individual
projects. That makes them also a lot less dependent on Jenkins itself.

[TestSwarm-BrowserStack](https://github.com/clarkbox/testswarm-browserstack)
is now using the TestSwarm 1.0.0 API, removing the dependency on
auto-increment IDs. Its also gotten better at dealing with BrowserStack
queue limits, making more efficient use of their service. The module now
has more documentation, making it easier to use for other projects.

Krinkle wrote [Automated Distributed Continuous Integration for
JavaScript](https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/wiki/Automated-Distributed-Continuous-Integration-for-JavaScript),
outlining how to combine all these various projects into one whole
automation setup.
