– needs review

Landed

– more reliable throws() assertion

Landed
[https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/384](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/384)
– module/test filters now work in IE7/8 with file protocol

Support for pending tests like Mocha? “tests without a function body
such that they show up in the list but have a different visual
representation and do not count as either a success or a failure;
rather, a new "pending" count is added as well.” – still not very
convincing.

Better async testing!

Mocha looks at callback signature and makes tests async when a callback
argument, usually named done, is present:
[http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/\#asynchronous-code](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/#asynchronous-code)

Can’t do that since we introduced the assert argument

Can do something like this:

-   test(…, function(assert) { var done = assert.async(); … done(); }
-   asyncTest(…, function(assert) { assert.done(); })

Going to land the two deprecation tickets, then release 1.11
