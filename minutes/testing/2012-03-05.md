Had the first QUnit IRC meeting this week, going through most open
tickets to figure out what to focus on. Some, like simulating events,
still need a lot more thinking and input, others will get addressed over
the next days/weeks. Will do a followup meeting, probably at the same
time (Thursday, noon EST).
