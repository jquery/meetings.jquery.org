Collaboration with BrowserStack is productive, jQuery Board got
accounts, working on integrating that with TestSwarm, with Scott
Gonz√°lez leading that effort.

Working with Jonathan Sharp on improving jquery-mockjax
([https://github.com/appendto/jquery-mockjax/](https://github.com/appendto/jquery-mockjax/)).
Moved docs to README on GitHub repo, integrated API docs there.
Testsuite is much better shape, working with a few collaborators on
fixes and enhancements.
