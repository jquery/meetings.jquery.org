June 21, 2012  

Location: \#jquery-meeting on Freenode

Attending: Corey, John Bender, Jörn

Time: Noon ET

QUnit

-   Website on staging is working with iframes
-   No major open issues:
    [https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues)
-   Rerun link for modules, to set module=… filter, should land in the
    next release:
    [https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/246](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/246)

TestSwarm

-   Milestone 1.0.0 still shifting, but getting closer:
    [https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues?milestone=1&state=open](https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues?milestone=1&state=open)
-   Krinkle experimented with opening a window instead of embedding
    iframes, mostly to address iframe-measuring issues in jQuery Core
    testsuite:
    [https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/195](https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/195)
-   Color, UI and QUnit jobs are solid, Core still has a few issues,
    Mobile isn’t on TestSwarm yet. Should start experimenting with that
    sometime soon.

Jenkins integration

Deploying -git builds for Core, UI, QUnit and Mobile, though no
consistent headers yet, and a very different setup for Mobile

Get sizzle on Jenkins and TestSwarm

-   Added grunt.js, will create job to run \`lint\` test once that is
    fixed

Perf regression testing

-   John Bender to explore this

Move to new service box

-   Sometime after the conference
-   Will remove \`scp\` step from git-build
-   Ask Clark to help with that, he can invest a few hours
