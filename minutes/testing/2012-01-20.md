Improving the testing infrastructure: BrowserStack integration is in
place, though various quirks still need to be ironed out. Improvements
of the TestSwarm output in Jenkins jobs is under way.

To focus efforts, the jQuery Mobile Jenkin's jobs are to be migrated
over to our (mt) hosted instance. They'll keep using Ruby/Selenium for
now, with the goal of migrating to the same TestSwarm/BrowserStack setup
as the other projects over the next months.
