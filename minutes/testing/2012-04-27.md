QUnit’s [composite
addon](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/tree/master/addons/composite) is
now using the new callback registration mechanism, making it a lot more
compatible with other code using those callbacks. Rerun links to open
the individual testsuite.

The QUnit website is coming together, with a docpad-based repo at
[https://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com](https://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com).
Contributions welcome! For now this is deployed via GitHub pages at
qunitjs.com, but will soon migrate to the WordPress-based deployment
that all other jQuery properties will use.

TestSwarm 1.0 is basically done, but still waits for updates on
BrowserStack and Jenkins integrations. Once those are done, TestSwarm
1.0 will be official. In the meantime, we’ve revived the [@TestSwarm
Twitter account](https://twitter.com/testswarm).
