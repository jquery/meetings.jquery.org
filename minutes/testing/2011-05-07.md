-   Presented QUnit and TestSwarm at [sapo.pt](http://sapo.pt)Â and MS
    HTML5 WebCamp in Lisbon, teasered Jenkins-Hudson integration
-   Aloha Editor started using QUnit, posted some testing strategy
    advice to their developer mailing list
-   Nothing new on Jenkins-TestSwarm plugin, still working on that

Todos:

-   Need a roadmap for both QUnit and TestSwarm to find contributors.
-   Look at code coverage tools, see if they could be used for jQuery
    projects, maybe integrated with Jenkins
