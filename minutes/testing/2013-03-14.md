QUnit

-   qunit-reporter-junit in its own  
     repo, running current grunt, built by Travis-CI
-   composite addon updated in master  
     (
    [https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/408](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/408)  
     ), James will move to its own repo soon
-   Discussing replacing callbacks  
     with events:
    [https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/422](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/422)  
     - Timo to work on that
-   Refactored assertion addons, add  
     assertions to QUnit.assert (
    [https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/418](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/418)  
     )
-   Update QUnit to grunt 0.4 (
    [https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/423](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/423)  
     )
-   add-on vs plugin vs extension?  
     Let’s go with **plugin**. And publish them to npm.
-   Browser support for QUnit (
    [https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/412](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/412)
    ) vs  
     plugins? Should they match? Will jQuery 1.x support IE6 forever?
-   We’ll keep the PhantomJS plugin:

Jenkins/Travis

We’d like to run \`grunt\` for all  
 PRs – Travis makes this really easy, mergatron should do it, too.

We want TestSwarm for regular  
 commits, this won’t work with Travis, since it can’t expose
confidential  
 credentials to PR committers.

TODO: Add a few more projects to  
 Travis, gives us basic testing for PRs

-   travis.yml to init/update  
     submodules, npm install -g grunt-cli
-   npm install && npm test  
     is done on travis by default

We can use that at least until  
 mergatron can do it better.

TestSwarm

-   projects update shelved for a  
     week, until higher priority issues are resolved (infrastructure,  
     BrowserStack)
