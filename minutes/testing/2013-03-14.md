* Attending: James, Scott, Ghislain, Jörn, Richard, Timo

## QUnit
* qunit-reporter-junit in its own repo, running current grunt, built by Travis-CI
* composite addon updated in master ( https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/408 )
  - James will move to its own repo soon
* Discussing replacing callbacks with events: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/422
  - Timo to work on that
* Refactored assertion addons, add assertions to QUnit.assert ( https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/418 )
* Update QUnit to grunt 0.4 ( https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/423 )
* add-on vs plugin vs extension?
  - Let’s go with plugin. And publish them to npm.
* Browser support for QUnit ( https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/412 ) vs plugins? Should they match? Will jQuery 1.x support IE6 forever?
* We’ll keep the PhantomJS plugin: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/420#issuecomment-14909617

## Jenkins/Travis
* We’d like to run `grunt` for all PRs – Travis makes this really easy, mergatron should do it, too.
* We want TestSwarm for regular commits, this won’t work with Travis, since it can’t expose confidential credentials to PR committers.
* TODO: Add a few more projects to Travis, gives us basic testing for PRs
  - travis.yml to init/update submodules, npm install -g grunt-cli
  - npm install && npm test is done on travis by default
* We can use that at least until mergatron can do it better.

## TestSwarm
* projects update shelved for a week, until higher priority issues are resolved (infrastructure, BrowserStack)
