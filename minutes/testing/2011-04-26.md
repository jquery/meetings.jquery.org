QUnit

-   A few minor fixes
-   Dropped support for long-deprecated \#main in favor of
    \#qunit-fixture. jQuery UI was already up-to-date, core got updated.
-   Now on jQuery CDN with some extra info in the
    header: [http://code.jquery.com/qunit/qunit-git.js](http://code.jquery.com/qunit/qunit-git.js) [http://code.jquery.com/qunit/qunit-git.css](http://code.jquery.com/qunit/qunit-git.css)
-   Published CLI integration for PhantomJS, for now in a
    branch: [https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/cli-phantomjs/test.js](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/cli-phantomjs/test.js) -
    still need to figure out how to bundle that along with node and
    rhino integration
