A few small fixes landed in QUnit: The testresult element now displays
what test is currently running, which helps with lots of async test and
“Hide passed tests” enabled. Update grunt.js to latest Grunt version.

Lots of work in progress on TestSwarm, thanks to Timo ‘Krinkle’ Tijhof.
Still working on [refactoring to page/action
structure](https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/132).
