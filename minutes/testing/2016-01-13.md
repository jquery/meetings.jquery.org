* before/after PR:
  * https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/919
  * needs docs
  * needs code review
* contributors and members:
  * Mixed is helping a lot, it's good to call him for more contributions.
  * Raphamorim expressed a will to contribute frequently, needs some guidance on code style and current issues.
  * Let's try async meetings on emails?
* QUnit release
  * testing and releasing a new version (patch/minor?) before the before/afer PR
  * main reason: time. I (Leo) don't want to wait so long between releases. It's also easier to detect regressions.
* js-reporter: needs update
* node-qunit: needs update
