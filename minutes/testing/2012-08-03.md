Time: Noon ET

QUnit

Need to review [pull requests](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pulls)
and other [issues](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues)

-   [\#287](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/287) will land module
    select after some cleanup
-   [\#289](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/289) look into
    enhancing validTest to always accept global failure
-   [\#292](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/292) move .html() reset
    to Core (and maybe UI)
-   [\#291](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/291#issuecomment-7460089)
    looks invalid

TestSwarm

BrowserStack running better now, all UI jobs green without us changing
anything

Corey working on post-commit hooks, will use those for testswarm and
testswarm-browserstack to deploy updates in the future

John Bender working on getting Mobile fixed in IE9, a few (swarm)
heisenbugs make that not as much fun

Need to move testswarm-browserstack to jquery account, use Krinkle’s
fork as starting point. Ask Clark though to move his repo to keep forks
and issues.

-   Merge Corey’s experiments, see
    /usr/local/tools/testswarm-browserstack/gnarf-test.js
    on[jq03.jquery.com](http://jq03.jquery.com/)
-   Also look into upgrading to v2 BrowserStack API, node-browserstack
    already supports that

Move to new service box

-   Done, [swarm.jquery.org](http://swarm.jquery.org) running on new
    server
