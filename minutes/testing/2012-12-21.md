********Location: \#jquery-meeting on Freenode

Attending: Scott, Dave, Rodney, Jörn

Time: 11am ET (16:00 UTC)

 

QUnit

[\#378 – codebase split](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/378). If
so, how? Follow jQuery Core? UMD/AMD?

-   Check out what James suggested (lodash UMD), otherwise just copy
    approach from Core, release single file on CDN and NPM

[\#352 – Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access
frame](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/352) – what is going on?

[\#347 – Add assertion to run after loading source to look for
globals](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/347#issuecomment-11479580)
– add a resource loader to QUnit? Would need a prototype. The
global-leaks check doesn’t seem worth the trouble though.

TestSwarm

-   Timo sent [PR to update
    node-testswarm](https://github.com/jzaefferer/node-testswarm/pull/7)
-   [Need to get rid of iframe for running
    tests](https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/195)
