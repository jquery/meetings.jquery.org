QUnit

-   Explicit ordering of module  
     names?
    [https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/392](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/392)  
     - wil land that
-   Need to add (CI) tests for  
     non-browser enviroments and fix the regression there:
    [https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/401](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/401)
-   Issues with QUnit.equiv and  
     circular references:
    [https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/397](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/397)  
     - gnarf looking at this
-   James working on Composite addon.  
     Trying to get rid of some hacks. May need to expose some more
    QUnit  
     internals.
-   69 replies to the survey, will  
     process the results in the next days. Big points: Most people don’t
    know  
     about add-ons. A lot of people are interested in CI tools.

TestSwarm

-   Timo working on projects  
     refactoring
-   Puppetized localSettings.json, no  
     more edit-on-live server when we need to change our browset sets.

BrowserStack integration

-   Got BrowserStack access to our Splunk  
     dashboard. Already helping to fix issues on their end.
-   Now hoping to figure out why we  
     loose so many workers.
