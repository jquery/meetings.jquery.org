Closed a big bunch of QUnit tickets this week, closing most pull
requests and almost all bug tickets. New release coming up soon.

Also working on the QUnit site again, [custom footer in theme already
done](https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/628ca854c143a54fdcd4ec90a984989b735ddcb7).
