Location: \#jquery-meeting on Freenode

Attending: Scott, Corey, Jörn

Time: Noon ET

QUnit

-   Working fine for us, not so great when tests are loaded async, e.g.
    with requirejs:
    [https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/358](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/358)
    – have QUnit.start() wait for QUnit.load (if there’s a dom), if
    there’s none, init immediately. Wrap the DOM access in QUnit.init()
    to make that also work without DOM.
-   Deprecate/remove QUnit.reset?
    [https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/354](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/354)
    – yes
-   Deprecated/remove expect argument from test() and asyncTest()?
    [https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/356](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/356)
    – yep
-   Find a better diff implementation?
    [https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/335](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/335)
    and
    [https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/348](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/348)
    – will try jsdiff, along with a leaf-differ (\#363 and \#364)
-   A bunch of PRs from JamesMGreen, needs review.
-   Added diff label and two more tickets to try jsdiff and implement a
    leaf-differ:
    [https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues?labels=diff&page=1&state=open](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues?labels=diff&page=1&state=open)

TestSwarm

-   Lots of trouble with BrowserStack lately. Apparently their broken
    VMs only get fixed when we report the issue. Corey got IE7 and
    Safari 6 VMs fixed
-   A few jobs, especially in IE8 fail to submit results with “”Error
    connecting to server”
-   TestSwarm rewrite well on the way. Is now using ua-parser, much less
    maintenance in TestSwarm itself and testswarm-browserstack.

testswarm-browserstack

-   Rewrite finished. Much less maintenance required here as well. More
    advanced and machine-readable log output (Splunk!) and smarter
    worker spawn management, and more (see commit log for more details).

Mergeatron

Experimenting for jquery core

-   To be moved to a separate testswarm account
-   Refactor grunt-testswarm to not need changes for mergeatron/PR.

Jenkins builds are put in directory /build/\<project\>/PR-\<\#\>. This
is a problem as those are non-unique (more than 1 commit per PR). Should
use the commit hash like we do for other builds. Though builds are
synchronous, a run can be reset later in time. If the directory has
changed, the re-run will be incorrect.

-   Also, job name: “pull \#123” -\> “pull \#123 – commit \#af04”.
