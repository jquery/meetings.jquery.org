QUnit

Landed module filter select. Now it is trivial to filter by module, so
much more convenient.

A few [PRs](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pulls) and
[issues](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues) to review

-   [New PR 302 for cumulative
    expect](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/302) – makes
    QUnit.expect() also a getter, but doesn’t change anything else.
    Looks good, will land.
-   [More info for callbacks, PR
    300](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/300) – closed
-   Any reason to expose the Test object? [PR
    293](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/293) – not really, closed
-   [Closed the server-people-dont-like-tests
    PR](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/295)
-   Will look into implementing
    [\#304](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/304) – QUnit can do
    more to restore scroll position, likely just scrolling back to top.
-   Will look into implement
    [\#279](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/279)
-   Closed [\#291 as
    invalid](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/291)
-   Will land [\#289](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/289) without
    the kludgy test

TestSwarm

-   Jenkins/TestSwarm/BrowserStack running pretty stable, lots of green
-   Maintaining browser mappings is annoying. Will get a little easier
    once testswarm-browserstack is moved to jquery orga. Maybe a bit
    more easier when moving TestSwarm to ua-parser.
