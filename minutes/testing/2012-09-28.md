QUnit

[PRs](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pulls) and
[issues](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues) to review

-   [\#317](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/317#issuecomment-8849976)
    is looking for an assertion method to compare objects with different
    constructors
-   [\#320](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/320#issuecomment-8899658)
    has an example of loading tests asynchronously. Recommendation is to
    use autostart=false, then start(), to make that work. Other ideas?
-   Will land [pull \#323](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/323)
    unless anyone has concerns – just quotes “throws” to make old
    interpreters not throw up
-   [\#326](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/326) asks for in
    “inconclusive” assertion, aka “needs a test”. Opinions?
-   [\#314](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/314#issuecomment-8302634)
    – throw up or log a failed assertion when calling start() while
    already running?
-   Related to \#320 and \#314 is
    [\#309](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/309)

TestSwarm

-   Blog post about TestSwarm
-   1.0 Roadmap
-   web site in November? Also needs new logo:
    [https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/128](https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/128)
-   Timo is working on testswarm-browserstack rewrite, will land update
    soon, makes it a lot more reliable
-   Up next: Improve keep-alive to get rid of timed-out clients faster;
    should make proper use of the ping-system implemented in TestSwarm
    recently
-   Richard still working on ua-parser ticket:
    [https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/187](https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/187)

botio/mergatron

-   What’s the next step to start using that?
-   We should integrate that with the Commit Status API:
