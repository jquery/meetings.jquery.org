Second QUnit meeting happened on Thursday. The focus was on triaging all
existing tickets. In the process we closed a few as invalid, fixed two
with actual code changes, and clarified a few other. Â Documentation
tickets will be handled once the [qunitjs.com](http://qunitjs.com) site
is a little further. Once module filtering and their visual display is
improved, 1.7.0 is ready for release.
